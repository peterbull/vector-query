ARTICLE I 

Public Access to Records 
§ 2-1. Purpose. 
The purpose of these rules and regulations is to provide guidelines for the care, custody, retention, disposition and accessibility of public records of the Town of East Hampton pursuant to Public Officers Law, Article 6, §§ 84 through 90. 
§ 2-2. Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
PUBLIC RECORDS  Any information kept, held, filed, produced or reproduced by, with or for an agency or the state legislature, in any physical form whatsoever, including, but not limited to, reports, statements, examinations, memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers, designs, drawings, maps, photos, letters, microfilms, computer tapes or discs, rules, regulations or codes. 
TOWN  Town department agencies, including, but not limited to, any water district, sewage district, drainage district or other special district established by law for any purpose operating for and on behalf of the Town of East Hampton and directly under its jurisdiction. 
§ 2-3. Custodian of records. 
The Town Clerk shall have custody of all the records, books and papers of the Town. However, since official records of the Town of East Hampton are so vast and since the efficient operation of the Town's daily business requires that official records be maintained in close proximity to where such daily business takes place and since § 146 of the Education Law2 authorizes the filing and storage of records in the buildings in which they are ordinarily used, the various department heads who have care and custody of official records shall: 
A. Act for and be under the direction of the Town Clerk in all matters concerning records retention, maintenance, filing, disposition and accessibility to the public. 
B. Be held responsible for all laws, rules and regulations imposed upon the Town Clerk as official custodian of the Town records. 
§ 2-4. Public information requests. 
A. Individual department, division or bureau heads shall make available records to the public in compliance with the New York State Freedom of Information Law. The Town Clerk, as the custodian of all the records, books and papers of the Town, shall be the receiver of all requests. The Town Clerk, as the custodian of all the records, books and papers of the Town, can direct any officer, department, division or bureau head or committee chairman as to the proper care, handling and disposition of any and all Town records, books and/or papers. If the request cannot be completed in the allocated five days, the Town Clerk shall send notice to the requestor of such information and provide a reasonable time frame for the completion of the FOIL request. 
2. Editor's Note: Said § 146 was repealed by L. 1983, c. 876, § 4, eff. 12-31-1983. 
§ 2-4 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 2-6 
B. The Town Attorney shall be the supervising officer for the purpose of any denial to records access pursuant to any request made under the New York State Freedom of Information Law. 
§ 2-5. Requesting FOIL documents. 
All FOIL requests shall be clear and concise and submitted using the form located on the Town of East Hampton's website at http://www.ehamptonny.gov. FOIL requests will be accepted via e-mail, mail, or fax. 
§ 2-6. Access to records; fees. 
The Freedom of Information Law, Public Officers Law, Article 6, §§ 84 through 90, endows the people with the authority to inspect and receive copies of certain records possessed by local governments. As a consequence, the Town Clerk and department heads who have custody of official Town of East Hampton records shall make available for public inspection: 
A. Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases, for example: 
(1) 
The final administrative decision in a disciplinary proceeding against an employee. 

(2) 
A final decision of the Board of Appeals in deciding an appeal from a Building Department decision. 

(3) 
Statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the Town and any statistical or factual tabulations which led to the formulation of the policy. 

(4) 
Minutes of meetings of the Town Board and of any public hearings. 

(5) 
Final versions of internal or external audits made by or for the Town. 

(6) 
Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect members of the public. 

(7) 
An itemized record setting forth the name, address, title and salary of every officer or employee, compiled by the fiscal officer charged with preparing payrolls.

limited to the procedure whereby a person who is required to file an annual financial disclosure statement may request an extension of time within which to file such statement, due to justifiable cause or undue hardship, as well as a date beyond which in all cases of justifiable cause or undue hardship no further extension of time will be granted. 
G. Application for amendment of statement. 
(1) 
The Board of Ethics shall permit any person required to file a financial disclosure statement pursuant to § 25-14 to submit a written application asking the Board of Ethics: 

(a) 
To delete one or more items of information from the copy of his or her financial disclosure statement which is made available for public inspection. 

(b) 
To grant an exemption from any requirement to report one or more items of information which pertain to such person's spouse or unemancipated children. 



(2) 
Such application shall accompany the filing of the financial disclosure statement. During the period of time that such application is pending before the Board of Ethics, any information that is the subject or a part of the application shall remain confidential. 

(3) 
The Board of Ethics shall consider the application and may delete such information from public inspection or may exempt such information pertaining to the spouse or unemancipated child upon a finding by a majority of the total number of members of the Board of Ethics without vacancy that the information which would otherwise be required to be disclosed, or would otherwise be required to be provided, will have no material bearing on the discharge of the reporting person's official duties. 

(4) 
If such request is denied, the Board of Ethics shall so inform the reporting person in writing. Upon receipt of such determination, the reporting individual may request, and upon such request the Board of Ethics shall provide, that any information which is the subject or part of the application shall remain confidential for a period of 30 days following notice of such determination. In the event the reporting individual resigns his or her office and holds no other position subject to the reporting requirements set forth in this chapter, the information shall not be made public and shall be expunged in its entirety. 

(5) 
The Board of Ethics' denial of a request pursuant to this subsection shall become final 30 days after its issuance. 


H. The Board of Ethics shall inspect all of the filed financial disclosure statements to ascertain whether any person subject to the reporting requirement set forth in § 25-14 has failed to file such a statement, has filed a deficient statement, or has filed a statement which reveals a possible violation of this Code of Ethics or of Article 18 of the General Municipal Law. 
I. If a person required to file a financial disclosure statement with the Board of Ethics has failed to file a disclosure statement or has filed a deficient statement, the Board of Ethics shall notify the reporting person in writing, state the failure to file or detail the deficiency, provide the person with a fifteen-day period to make such filing or cure such deficiency and advise the person of the penalties for failure to comply with the reporting requirements. Such notice shall be confidential. If the person fails to make such filing or fails to cure the deficiency within the specified time period, the Board of Ethics shall send a notice of delinquency to the reporting person and to the Town Board. 
J. Violations. 
(1) 
If a reporting person has filed a financial disclosure statement which reveals a possible violation of this Code of Ethics or Article 18 of General Municipal Law, or if the Board of Ethics receives a sworn complaint alleging such a violation, or if the Board of Ethics determines on its own initiative to investigate a possible violation, the Board of Ethics shall notify the reporting person in writing, describe the possible or alleged violation of this Code of Ethics or Article 18 of General Municipal Law and provide the person with a fifteen-day period in which to submit a written response setting forth information relating to the activities cited as a possible or alleged violation of law. 

(2) 
If the Board of Ethics thereafter makes a determination that further inquiry is justified, it shall give the reporting individual an opportunity to be heard. The reporting person shall be entitled to a hearing according to due process procedures and subject to any applicable provisions of law and collective bargaining agreements. 

(3) 
If the Board of Ethics determines at any stage of the proceeding that there is no violation or that any potential conflict of interest violation has been rectified, the Board of Ethics shall so advise the reporting person and the complainant, if any. All of the foregoing proceedings shall be confidential. 

(4) 
If the Board of Ethics determines, pursuant to the hearing, that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, it shall send a notice of reasonable cause to the reporting person, to the complainant, if any, and to the Town Board. In its discretion, the Ethics Board may recommend to the Town Board disciplinary action. In addition, if the Board of Ethics determines pursuant to such hearing, that a reporting individual has knowingly and willfully failed to file an annual statement of financial disclosure, or has knowingly and willfully with intent to deceive made a false statement or given information that such individual knows to be false on a statement of financial disclosure filed pursuant to § 25-14, the Board of Ethics shall recommend to the Town Board an amount, not to exceed $10,000, to be assessed against the reporting individual. 

(5) 
The Town Board shall receive the recommendation(s) of the Ethics Board. The Board may review the findings of fact and the record, if any, as shall be made available to it by the Ethics Board. The Town Board may take such disciplinary action, impose such penalties as provided in this chapter, or make a recommendation that the matter be referred to the appropriate prosecuting authority, as it deems to be appropriate and just. If the Town Board determines to assess a civil penalty, it shall provide the reporting person with a notice of civil assessment. Said assessment of civil penalty shall become final 30 days after the notice of civil assessment is issued. 


K. Advisory opinions. 
(1) The Board of Ethics shall render advisory opinions solely to officers and employees of the Town with respect to this Code of Ethics and Article 18 of the General Municipal Law.

Board of Ethics or pursuant to a resolution of the Town Board. Such advisory opinions shall be rendered under such rules and regulations as the Board of Ethics may prescribe.

(3) 
A request for an advisory opinion shall be confidential, but the Board of Ethics may publish such opinions, provided that the name of the requesting person and other identifying details are not included in the publication. The Board of Ethics shall endeavor, to the extent practicable, to publish its advisory opinions, so as to assist Town officers and employees in complying with applicable laws.

Best Value Contracts [Adopted 9-21-2017 by L.L. No. 35-2017] 
§ 52-1. Short title and legislative intent. 
A. This local law shall be known as the "Town of East Hampton Best Value Contract Award Law." 
B. The purpose of this local law is to authorize the Town to use of best value criteria when awarding purchase contracts in addition to lowest responsible bidder, in instances where such an award is permitted, consistent with § 103 of the General Municipal Law and § 163 of the New York State Finance Law. Use of best value criteria will provide the Town Board with greater flexibility in awarding contracts, ensuring that the Town obtains the highest quality goods at a low cost. The "best value" option may be used when it is more cost-efficient over time to award the good or service to other than the lowest responsible bidder or offeror if factors such as lower cost of maintenance, durability, high quality and longer product life can be documented. 
§ 52-2. Applicability. 
These provisions shall apply to Town purchase contracts, including contracts for services, but shall exclude purchase contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract pursuant to Article 8 of the New York Labor Law or any such other contract which may be deemed ineligible for the use of best value award by state law. 
§ 52-3. Requirements. 
Goods and services may be procured on the basis of best value when the Town Board determines that doing so will optimize quality, cost and efficiency among responsive and responsible bidder or offerors. 
A. Whenever any contract is awarded on the basis of best value instead of lowest responsible bidder, the basis for determining best value shall be thoroughly and accurately documented. 
B. The determination of quality and cost-efficiency shall be based on objectively quantified and clearly described and documented criteria, which may include, but shall not be limited to, any or all of the following: cost of maintenance; proximity to the end user if distance or response time is a significant term; durability; availability of replacement parts or maintenance contractors; longer product life; product performance criteria; and quality of craftsmanship. 
C. General evaluation criteria shall be identified in the Town's procurement policy, a copy of which shall be maintained in the Department of Purchasing and be made available to the public. 
D. The Senior Purchasing Agent shall establish specific evaluation criteria that will be relied upon for procuring goods based upon best value, which shall be maintained in the Purchasing Department and made available to the public. 
E. Solicitation documents shall state the minimum requirements and specifications that must be met in order for the bidder to be deemed responsible and shall identify the general 
procedure and manner in which the evaluation and selection shall be conducted.

D. Proof of service made pursuant to this chapter shall be filed with the Bureau and, where service is made by certified mail, shall include the return receipt evidencing receipt of the notice served by mail. Service shall be complete 10 days after such filing. 
E. Where service of a notice of violation is not made in a manner authorized by law for the violation charged, it shall be dismissed at the request of the respondent, or the administrative law judge may dismiss the notice of violation upon his or her own motion. 
F. The original or a copy of the notice of violation shall be filed and retained by the Bureau and shall be deemed a record kept in the ordinary course of business. 
§ 62-8. Adjudicatory hearings. 
A. All hearings shall be held in the Town of East Hampton during regular business hours at such place as the Director shall designate from time to time. The adjudication of a charge of a violation shall be by way of a hearing before an administrative law judge. However, in accordance with the rules of the Director, in certain circumstances where the respondent has admitted the violation charged and paid the applicable monetary penalty and surcharge for administrative costs, the respondent need not appear for a hearing before an administrative law judge. 
B. The Town Attorney has the burden of proving any charge of a violation by a preponderance of the evidence. In that regard, the notice of violation, if sworn to or affirmed, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. The notice of violation shall constitute the testimony of the signator and, when filed with the Bureau, shall be admitted into evidence as such testimony at any hearing on the violation charged. Every such notice of violation shall state whether the facts set forth therein are known personally to the signator, and if the facts are not so known the notice of violation shall specifically identify the source of knowledge of such facts. If the respondent disputes the facts stated in the notice of violation, the administrative law judge, where appropriate, may reject the signator's facts, accept facts the respondent offers, or direct the signator's appearance. 
C. The respondent may be represented by legal counsel. The respondent shall be given an 
§ 62-8 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 62-10 
opportunity to present written argument on issues of law and to present evidence and argument on issues of fact. All testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. 
D. The administrative law judge may, in his or her discretion or at the request of the respondent, on a showing of good cause, subpoena the attendance of witnesses and/or the production of relevant books, records or other information. 
E. A record shall be made of every hearing either by stenographic recording or by mechanical or electronic method as the Director shall determine. A transcript of such record shall be supplied to the respondent upon application and the payment of a transcription fee. 
§ 62-9. Final decisions and judgments. 
A. After the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative law judge shall make final findings of fact, and a final determination, decision or order with respect to the charge of a violation. All such findings of fact, determinations, decisions and orders shall be written, and shall be rendered in an expeditious manner. 
B. Where the charge of a violation has been sustained, the administrative law judge shall impose a monetary penalty within the range of monetary penalties authorized by the applicable provision of the Town Code. However, the administrative law judge shall have the discretion, which shall rarely be exercised, to waive the imposition of a monetary penalty in extraordinary circumstances upon good cause shown. 
C. Where the charge of a violation has been sustained, there may be levied, in addition to the monetary penalty, a surcharge for administrative costs in an amount as set by resolution from time to time by the Town Board. 
D. A final determination of an administrative law judge imposing a monetary penalty and assessing a surcharge for administrative costs, whether the adjudication was held by hearing or upon default or otherwise, shall constitute a judgment rendered by the Bureau against the respondent which may be entered in the Town Justice Court, and may be enforced against the respondent and his, her or its property without court proceedings in the same manner as the enforcement of money judgments entered in civil actions; provided, however, that no such judgment shall be entered which exceeds the jurisdiction of the Town Justice Court. 
E. Where any final decision or order may not be entered and enforced as a judgment because the amount of monetary penalty exceeds the jurisdictional amount of the Town Justice Court with respect to actions and proceedings for the recovery of money, such decision or order may be enforced by the commencement of an action or proceeding for the recovery of such monetary penalties in a court of competent jurisdiction by the Town Attorney in the name of the Town of East Hampton. 
F. Any unpaid judgment related to a violation on a property in the Town of East Hampton shall become a lien on said property subject to the collection as a tax thereon. 
§ 62-10. Default judgments. 
A. Where a respondent has failed to plead within the time allowed by the rules adopted by the Director regarding the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings before the Board, or has failed to appear on the designated hearing date or subsequent date following an adjournment, such failure to plead or appear shall be deemed, for all purposes, to be an admission of liability and shall be grounds for rendering a default decision and order imposing as a monetary penalty the maximum amount prescribed under law for the violation charged. A default decision and order may be opened within one year of its entry upon written application showing excusable default and a defense to the charge; a default decision and order may thereafter be opened in the discretion of the Director only upon written application showing excusable default, a defense to the charge, and good cause for the delay. 
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, before a judgment based upon a default may be so entered, the Bureau must have notified the respondent by first class mail in such form as the Director may require: (1) of the default decision and order and the penalty imposed; (2) that a judgment may be entered in the Town Justice Court; and (3) that entry of such judgment may be avoided by requesting a stay of default for good cause shown and by either requesting a hearing or entering a plea in the manner set forth in the notice of violation within 30 days of the mailing of such notice. 
§ 62-11. Administrative appeal. 
A. There shall be one or more administrative appeals panels within the Bureau. Each panel shall consist of three administrative law judges. In no event shall the administrative law judge from whom such appeal of a decision, determination or order is taken be included in the panel determining such appeal. Administrative law judges serving on the administrative appeals panel shall not regularly conduct administrative hearings, but shall serve primarily as administrative appeals panel members. 
B. A respondent may appeal, on the facts and/or the law, a final decision, final determination or final order. An agency of the Town of East Hampton aggrieved by a final decision, final determination or final order may appeal on the law, but only after notice to the respondent and a finding by the appeals panel that the issue upon which the agency seeks to appeal is significant and affects the agency's legitimate enforcement functions. 
C. Upon rendering a final decision, making a final determination or issuing a final order adverse to the respondent, the administrative law judge shall provide the respondent with a form notice of appeal and shall explain to the respondent in writing (1) the method of filing the notice and the applicable time limits; (2) the requirements set forth below concerning the payment of the applicable penalty and surcharge or the posting of a bond pending appeal, including the right to request exemption therefrom; and (3) that no further court challenge is permitted by law unless an administrative appeal is taken. 
D. A notice of appeal shall be filed with the appeals panel within 30 days of the entry of such decision, determination or order. 
E. For good cause shown, the administrative appeals panel may permit the filing of a notice of appeal after the thirty-day period. 
F. The appeals panel shall have the power to review the record and the findings of the administrative law judge and may reverse, modify or remand any such decision, determination or order appealed therefrom. 
G. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, no appeal of a decision, determination or order of an administrative law judge imposing a monetary penalty shall be decided unless such penalty and the applicable surcharge for administrative costs are paid or a cash or 
§ 62-11 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 73-1 
recognized surety company bond is posted in the full amount of such monetary penalty and administrative surcharge. However, no such payment or posting of such bond is required where the respondent is the holder of a current license or permit for the operation of a business issued by the Town of East Hampton. Upon a showing of undue hardship or where justice may require, the administrative law judge who decided the case or the appellate panel to which the appeal is assigned may order that the appeal shall be decided without requiring such payment or posting of such bond. 
H. The determination of the appeals panel shall be rendered within 90 days after the submission of all relevant papers to the panel. 
I. The determination of the appeals panel shall be the final determination of the Bureau for the purposes of review pursuant to Article 78 of the New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules. 
J. Where the respondent prevails on administrative appeal or after judicial review pursuant to Article 78 of the New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules, any monetary penalty and surcharge paid to the Town of East Hampton shall be returned with interest at the rate set by the Commissioner of Finance of the City of New York for the refund of overpayments of business taxes pursuant to Section 11-537 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
§ 62-12. Judicial enforcement. 
Any order or subpoena or any final decision or determination rendered by an administrative law judge or the appeals panel shall be subject to enforcement in an action or proceeding commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction by the prevailing party including the Town of East Hampton. 
§ 62-13. Restriction on collateral use. 
Decisions, determination and orders issued by an administrative law judge or the appeals panel shall not be cited, and shall not be considered precedent nor be given any force or effect in any criminal proceeding.

§ 79-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 79-10 
ARTICLE I 
§ 79-10. Purpose. 
A. Police and fire alarm devices play an important role in our community's efforts to safeguard life and property. However, the effectiveness of an alarm device is diminished if public safety personnel cannot quickly locate and access the site from which the alarm signal emanates. 
B. This chapter requires owners and lessees of property, both residential and nonresidential, upon which fire and/or police alarm systems have been installed to register the same with the Town Clerk. In addition, all commercial structures and new residential structures, or existing residential properties for which a building permit is issued, having fire alarm systems which, when activated, transmit a signal to a central alarm station shall be required to provide a key lock box and, if required by the Fire Marshal, an information storage cabinet, which will assist the responding fire department in gaining access to the premises, as well as providing important information which can assist the responding emergency services department during an emergency call. Standards are also adopted to assure that gates, walls, fences, berms and other physical barriers do not unnecessarily impede access of emergency response vehicles. 
C. By imposing charges for multiple false alarms in a calendar year, the Town hopes to create a heightened sense among persons using alarm devices to take whatever steps are necessary to decrease the occurrence of false alarms and thereby avoid diverting the attention and energy of the personnel of the Town Police Department and the various fire departments from true emergencies and other important activities.

The Town Board finds that the consumption of all forms of alcoholic beverages upon the public streets and ways and in all other public places in the Town of East Hampton, outside of the incorporated villages therein, by operators and occupants of motor vehicles, motorcycles, motor-driven cycles and bicycles, as well as by pedestrians, constitutes a nuisance and a hazard to the health and safety of the citizens of the community. Such consumption endangers all persons using such public streets, ways and places and causes the littering of such areas and adjacent private properties with bottles, cans and other containers. It is further found that the preservation and protection of peace and good order and the protection of the property, health and safety of the inhabitants of the Town and of the users of all public places therein require that the unauthorized consumption of all alcoholic beverages in such public places be prohibited.

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Town of East Hampton Domestic Partnership Law." 
§ 90-2. Purpose and objectives. 
A. The Town's interest in strengthening and supporting all caring, committed and responsible family forms has led to the definition and recognition of "domestic partnership" (explained below) as a relationship and family unit. 
B. This article establishes a mechanism for the public expression and documentation of the commitment reflected by the "domestic partnership" whose members cannot or choose not to marry. 
C. It is appropriate and fair that certain of the societal privileges and benefits now accorded to members of a marriage be extended to those who meet the qualifications of a domestic partnership. The mechanism established by this chapter will facilitate the definition of those entitled to such privileges. 
§ 90-3. Requirements. 
A domestic partnership shall exist between two persons if the following is true:

F. The persons currently share a primary residence and declare that they intend to do so for the indefinite future. 
G. The persons declare that they are in a relationship of mutual support, caring and commitment and are responsible for each other's welfare. For these purposes, "mutual support" means that they contribute mutually to each other's maintenance and support. 
H. Both persons agree to file a termination of partnership if there is a change in the status of their domestic partnership. 
I. The persons shall file a statement of domestic partnership as set forth in this chapter and pay the required fee.

The domestic partnership statement shall further state that the domestic partners comply with the requirements of § 90-3 of this chapter. 


B. Amendment of domestic partnership statement. Partners may amend the statement at any time in order to change an address by filing an amended statement.

(1) 
The domestic partnership is terminated; and 

(2) 
A copy of the termination statement has been mailed to the other domestic partner. 


D. New statements of domestic partnership. No person who has filed a statement of domestic partnership may file another statement of domestic partnership until six months after the termination statement of a previous partnership has been filed with the Town Clerk. 
§ 90-5. Filing of statements; fees. 
Anyone who has signed a statement of domestic partnership may file it with the Town Clerk. The statement of domestic partnership, termination statement or amendment of domestic partnership statement shall not be deemed effective until filed with the Town Clerk according to the provisions of this article. 
A. Form of statements. All statements relating to domestic partnerships shall be notarized and executed as declaration made under penalty of perjury. The Town Clerk shall provide forms as necessary to interested individuals. 
B. Fees for statements. The Town Clerk shall charge a fee of $25 for the filing of a domestic partnership statement and a fee of $25 for the filing of termination statement. The payment of the above fee entitles the person filing a statement on behalf of the domestic partnership to two copies of the statement certified by the Town Clerk.

ACCESS  A means of entry to or exit from a beach. 
BEACH  All land lying between a body of fresh-or salt water and the base of a bluff or dune. In cases where there is no bluff or dune present, then the "beach" shall be all land lying between such body of water and the naturally occurring beach grass or the upland vegetation if no naturally occurring beach grass is present. 
BLUFF  A formation of land which is landward of the natural beach and which rises sharply from its base to a bluff line where the natural land contours resume a gradual slope. 
DUNE  A naturally occurring accumulation of sand in wind-formed ridges or mounds landward of the beach, often characterized by the natural growth of beach grass (Ammophila breviligulata). Included in this definition are deposits of fill placed for the purpose of dune construction. 
ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICE  Any product containing or delivering nicotine or any other substance intended for human consumption that can be used by a person in any manner for the purpose of inhaling vapor or aerosol from the product.

COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION (ENERGY) PROGRAM 
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 11-5-2020 by L.L. No. 7-2020. Amendments noted where applicable.] § 110-1. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority. 
A. It is the policy of both the Town of East Hampton and the State of New York to reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the purpose of economic development, to promote deeper penetration of energy efficiency and renewable energy resources such as wind and solar, and wider deployment of distributed energy resources as well as to examine the retail energy markets and increase participation of and benefits for eligible consumers in those markets. Among the policies and models that may offer benefits in New York is Community Choice Aggregation ("CCA"), which allows local governments to determine the default supplier of electricity and natural gas on behalf of eligible consumers. 
B. The purpose of CCA is to allow participating local governments to procure energy supply service for eligible consumers, who will have the opportunity to opt out of the procurement, while maintaining transmission and distribution service from the existing distribution utility. This chapter establishes a program ("CCA Program") that will allow the Town of East Hampton and other local governments to work together through a shared purchasing model to put out for bid the total amount of natural gas and/or electricity being purchased by eligible consumers within the jurisdictional boundaries of participating municipalities. Eligible consumers will have the opportunity to have more control to lower their overall energy costs, to spur clean energy innovation and investment, to improve customer choice and value, and to protect the environment. 
C. The Town of East Hampton is authorized to implement this CCA Program pursuant to § 10, Subdivision 1(ii)a(12), of the New York Municipal Home Rule Law and State of New York Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224, Proceeding on Motion of the Commission to Enable Community Choice Aggregation Programs (issued April 21, 2016), as may be amended, including subsequent orders of the Public Service Commission (PSC) issued in connection with or related to Case No. 14-M-0224, to the extent that orders related to Case No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the Town of East Hampton.

§ 110-7. Data protection requirements.

B. Customer-specific data shall be protected in a manner compliant with, collectively, (i) all national, state and local laws, regulations or other government standards relating to the protection of information that identifies or can be used to identify an individual that apply with respect to the Town or its representative's processing of confidential utility information; (ii) the utility's internal requirements and procedures relating to the protection of information that identifies or can be used to identify an individual that apply with respect to the Town or its representative's processing of confidential utility information; and (iii) the PSC CCA Order and PSC rules, regulations and guidelines relating to confidential data.

§ 110-11. Effective date.

The purpose of this local law is to set forth the procedure governing such permit process.

The establishment of local regulations concerning the installation, performance and maintenance of the early warning smoke and fire detectors in buildings devoted to residential use and occupancy, including single-family residences, multiple residences (including two-family dwellings), mixed occupancy buildings and accessory structures, will further this policy by providing for each such building a basic system of coverage which will give to all occupants thereof adequate and timely warning of fire.

§ 141-25. Purpose.31 
It is the policy of the Town of East Hampton to assure an adequate supply of water for fire­fighting purposes at or near the site of all residential and commercial developments. To this end, the Town, in cooperation with the various fire departments and districts which serve it, has required the installation of various fire protection devices, such as hydrants, wells and cisterns, which serve to supply water for fire-fighting purposes in the event of a conflagration.

§ 141-28. Penalties for offenses.

§ 151-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 151-2 
§ 151-1. Purpose. 
Assemblies or organized events which are anticipated to or are likely to attract a large number of people can adversely affect the well-being of Town residents. Large assemblies on public and private properties can disturb nearby residents in the peaceful enjoyment of their homes and property, interfere with the general public's normal use of highways and other municipal facilities, and be harmful to the public safety and welfare. Large assemblages of people result in the need for some control over traffic and parking and can cause a strain on police services, particularly during the summer season. In an effort to provide for the well-being of the community, the Town Board establishes herein a procedure whereby the Town can be informed in advance of assemblies and can assure that such assemblies, if appropriate under the Town Code and the Constitution of the State of New York, can be accommodated without unduly burdening the community or the resources of the Town of East Hampton or unreasonably impacting upon or restricting the use of Town resources by other Town residents. 
§ 151-2. Definitions.

CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION  An organization as defined in New York State Executive Law § 171-a, including but not limited to not-for-profit entities. Such charitable organizations shall be recognized as exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code § 501(c)(3), shall be duly registered with the Charities Bureau of the Attorney General of the State of New York, and shall provide services or funds that benefit residents of the Town of East Hampton. For purposes of this chapter, this category shall also be deemed to include established civic organizations which are formed for and do provide a public benefit and are not formed for and do not have as a primary purpose the accumulation of profits for their owners or members. Organizations such as Chambers of Commerce, veterans' organizations, fraternal organizations, and similar organizations which are actually located within the Town of East Hampton and provide benefits to members of the community qualify for this classification. 
CIRCUS  A public entertainment consisting typically of a variety of performances by acrobats, clowns, and trained animals. 
COMMERCIAL PREMISES  Property containing a legally nonconforming business use and any vacant or improved parcel in a commercial use district other than one upon which the principal use is one or more single-family residences.

Chapter 155 
LANDSCAPING AND GARDENING 
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 3-18-2021 by L.L. No. 7-2021. Amendments noted where applicable.] § 155-1. Findings. 
A. This local law establishes Chapter 155 of the Town Code, entitled "Landscaping," to advance the interests of Town residents in encouraging green landscaping practices, protecting public health by eliminating emissions from the use of gas-and diesel-powered leaf blowers, reducing noise, and deterring unlicensed landscapers. 
B. Based on this research and information from various sources, the Town Board finds that certain commercial landscaping and gardening activities do pose a risk of noise, odor, and pollution that may otherwise disturb the public health and welfare of Town residents. Scientific studies have been presented to this Board indicating that emissions from gas-powered leaf-blowing equipment can cause deleterious health effects for those in the vicinity of their use. Further, the use of this equipment causes an unreasonable amount of 
noise that is detrimental to the quiet enjoyment of neighboring residences. 
C. The current Town Code, though requiring home improvement contractor's licenses for commercial landscapers who also do installations of outdoor improvements such as walkways, patios, and similar structures as a part of their services, does not require a license for commercial landscapers who only engage in property maintenance such as cutting lawns and raking and disposing of leaves. However, the Town requires a mechanism to contact commercial landscapers working within the Town to assure that they are aware of the restrictions and limitations placed upon such activities by this local law, and to adequately enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
D. This chapter, adopted pursuant to the authority of the Town Law and the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of New York, will limit the use of gas-and diesel-powered leaf blowers, and all leaf blowers during certain days and times, and create a licensing requirement for commercial landscapers engaged in property maintenance. 
§ 155-2. Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

GARDENING  The tilling, sowing, cultivating, trimming, fertilizing, pruning, cutting, shaping, treating, spraying, or otherwise maintaining and/or providing care for any lawn, sod, trees, flowers, shrubs, bushes, plants, or other flora on any lot, plot, or parcel of land.

Chapter 160 
COMMUNITY HOUSING OPPORTUNITY FUND 
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 11-8-2022 by L.L. No. 33-2022.3536 Amendments noted where applicable.] § 160-1. Purpose. 
A. The East Hampton Town Board finds the provision of a variety of housing opportunities for community members across the economic spectrum to be key to maintaining the fabric of a healthy, sustainable community, allowing for a diverse makeup of residents along with a robust local workforce and viable businesses. 
B. A lack of affordable housing has resulted in a housing shortage, the impacts of which are increasingly evident, and Town participation is needed to provide new housing options and make existing housing accessible for moderate- and low-income working residents. 
C. East Hampton Town's unique demographics and economics contribute to this dynamic. The area's environment and beauty, along with its relative proximity to a major metropolitan area, make it a sought-after locale for luxury and seasonal vacation housing. 
D. The recent pandemic exacerbated the already high demand for existing housing as a growing number of people sought to relocate to East Hampton from more urban areas. This demand has reduced the housing available to year-round community members and is reflected in real estate values across the spectrum, including those for moderately priced housing. 
E. The availability of rental housing has been further diminished by property owners' increased use of online short-term rental agencies to make what once may have been year-round residents' housing available only for vacation, seasonal, or other short-term rentals, and by the lucrative real estate market, which has prompted a number of rental property owners to "cash out" and sell their rental properties, eliminating them from the rental housing stock. 
F. As a result of the housing crisis and high cost of housing for local individuals and families, longtime residents are forced to leave the area; employers are having difficulty finding and retaining employees; local volunteer emergency services agencies face difficulty in recruitment; traffic has increased as many who work in East Hampton must commute from elsewhere, and residents of the Town may be forced to live in illegal or substandard conditions. 
G. The Town Board wishes to sustain and strengthen our community by providing

opportunities for our local workforce to both live here and work here; for young people who have grown up in East Hampton to remain, continue to live near their families, and become contributing residents of their hometown; and for the people who make up our East Hampton community to have access to safe and affordable housing.

§ 162-2-10. Imposition of supplemental real estate transfer tax. 
There is hereby imposed in the Town of East Hampton a supplemental tax on each conveyance of real property or interest therein where the consideration exceeds $500, as authorized by Article 31-D of the New York Tax Law, the rate of such tax to be 0.5% of the consideration for the conveyance. Revenues from such tax shall be deposited in the Affordable Housing Fund established pursuant to Article I of this chapter and may be used solely for the purposes of said fund. Such tax shall apply to any conveyance occurring on or after the adoption of this chapter, but shall not apply to conveyances made on or after such date pursuant to binding written contracts entered into prior to such date, provided that the date of execution of such contract is confirmed by independent evidence such as the recording of the contract, payment of a deposit or other facts and circumstances as determined by the County Comptroller. 
§ 162-2-11. through § 162-2-14. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-15. Payment of tax. 
A. The supplemental real estate transfer tax imposed pursuant to this article shall be paid to the Comptroller, or to the recording officer acting as the agent of the Comptroller upon designation as such agent by the Comptroller. Such tax shall be paid at the same time as the real estate transfer tax imposed by Article 31 of the New York Tax Law is required to be paid. Such Comptroller or recording officer shall endorse upon each deed or instrument effecting a conveyance a receipt for the amount of the tax so paid. In no event shall the Town Tax Receiver have any responsibility to collect such funds on behalf of the Town. 
B. A return shall be required to be filed with such Comptroller or recording officer for purposes of the supplemental real estate transfer the tax imposed pursuant to Town Law § 64-K of the Town Law of the State of New York, as determined by the County Comptroller, at the same time as a return is required to be filed for purposes of the real estate transfer tax imposed by Article 31 of the Tax Law. The Comptroller shall prescribe the form of return, the information that it shall contain and the documentation that shall accompany the return. Said form shall be identical to the real estate transfer tax return required to be filed pursuant to § 1409 of the Tax Law, except that the Comptroller shall adapt said form to reflect the provisions of this article which are inconsistent with, different from or in addition to the provisions of Article 31 of the Tax Law. The real estate transfer tax returns required to be filed pursuant to this section are required to be preserved for three years and thereafter until such Comptroller or recording officer orders them to be 
destroyed. 
C. The recording officer shall not record an instrument effecting a conveyance unless the return required by this section has been filed and unless the tax imposed pursuant to this article shall have been paid as provided in this section. 
§ 162-2-16. through § 162-2-19. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-20. Liability for tax. 
A. The supplemental real estate transfer tax required hereunder shall be paid by the grantee. If the grantee has failed to pay the tax imposed pursuant to this article, or if the grantee is exempt from such tax, the grantor shall have the duty to pay the tax. Where the grantor has the duty to pay the tax because the grantee has failed to pay, such tax shall be the joint and several liability of the grantee and grantor. 
B. For the purpose of the proper administration of this article and to prevent evasion of the tax hereby authorized, it shall be presumed that all conveyances are taxable. Where the consideration includes property other than money, it shall be presumed that the consideration is the fair market value of the real property or interest therein. These presumptions shall prevail until the contrary is proven, and the burden of proving the contrary shall be on the person liable for payment of the tax.

§ 162-2-35. Credit for prior tax paid on creation of leasehold or grant of option or contract to purchase. 
A grantor shall be allowed a credit against the tax due on a conveyance of real property to the extent that tax was paid by such grantor on a prior creation of a leasehold of all or a portion of the same real property or on the granting of an option or contract to purchase all or a portion of the same real property by such grantor. Such credit shall be computed by multiplying the tax paid on the creation of the leasehold or on the granting of the option or contract by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the consideration used to compute such tax paid which is not yet due to such grantor on the date of the subsequent conveyance (and which such grantor will not be entitled to receive after such date) and the denominator of which is the total value of the consideration used to compute such tax paid. 
§ 162-2-36. through § 162-2-39. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-40. Cooperative housing corporation transfers.

(1) 
The original conveyance of shares of stock in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold by the cooperative corporation or cooperative plan sponsor. 

(2) 
The subsequent conveyance of such stock in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold by the owner thereof. With respect to any such subsequent conveyance where the property is an individual residential unit, the consideration for the interest conveyed shall exclude the value of any liens on certificates of stock or other evidence of an ownership interest in and a proprietary lease from a corporation or partnership formed for the purpose of cooperative ownership of residential interest in real estate remaining thereon at the time of conveyance. In determining the tax on a conveyance described in Subsection A(1) above, a credit shall be allowed for a proportionate part of the amount of any tax paid upon the conveyance to the cooperative housing corporation of the real property comprising the cooperative dwelling or dwellings to the extent that such conveyance 


§ 162-2-40 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 162-2-55 
effectuated a mere change of identity or form of ownership of such property and not a change in the beneficial ownership of such property. The amount of credit shall be determined by multiplying the amount of tax paid upon the conveyance to the cooperative housing corporation by a percentage representing the extent to which such conveyance effectuated a mere change of identity or form of ownership and not a change in the beneficial ownership of such property, and then multiplying the resulting product by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of stock conveyed in a transaction described in Subsection A(1) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of stock of the corporative housing corporation (including any stock held by the corporation). In no event, however, shall such credit reduce the tax on a conveyance described in Subsection A(1) below zero, nor shall any such credit be allowed for a tax paid more than 24 months prior to the date on which occurs the first in a series of conveyances of shares of stock in an offering of cooperative housing corporation shares described in Subsection A(1). 
B.

§ 162-2-41. through § 162-2-44. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-45. Designation of agent by County Comptroller.

The Comptroller shall provide for the manner in which such person may be designated as his agent subject to such terms and conditions as he shall prescribe. The real estate transfer tax shall be paid to such agent as provided in § 162-2-15 hereof. 
§ 162-2-46. through § 162-2-49. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-50. Liability of recording officer.

§ 162-2-51. through § 162-2-54. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-55. Refunds. 
Whenever the Comptroller shall determine that any moneys received under the provisions of this article were paid in error, he may cause such money to be refunded pursuant to such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, provided that any application for such refund is filed with the Comptroller within two years from the date the erroneous payment was made. 
§ 162-2-56. through § 162-2-59. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-60. Deposit and disposition of revenue. 
A. All taxes, penalties and interest imposed by the Town under the authority of this article, which are collected by the Comptroller or his agents, shall be deposited in a single trust fund for the Town and shall be kept in trust and separate and apart from all other moneys in possession of the Comptroller. Moneys in such fund shall be deposited and secured in the manner provided by § 10 of the General Municipal Law. Pending expenditure from such fund, moneys therein may be invested in the manner provided in § 11 of the General Municipal Law. Any interest earned or capital gain realized on the moneys so deposited or invested shall accrue to and become part of such fund. 
B. The Comptroller shall retain such amount as he may determine to be necessary for refunds with respect to the tax imposed by the Town under the authority of this article, out of which the Comptroller shall pay any refunds of such taxes to those taxpayers entitled to a refund pursuant to the provisions of this article. 
C. The Comptroller, after reserving such funds, shall on or before the 12th day of each month pay to the Town Supervisor the taxes, penalties and interest imposed by the Town under the authority of this article, collected by the Comptroller pursuant to this article during the proceeding calendar month. The amount so payable shall be certified to the Town Supervisor by the Comptroller, who shall not be held liable for any inaccuracy in such certification. However, any such certification may be based on such information as may be available to the Comptroller at the time such certification must be made under this section. 
D. Where the amount so paid over to the Town in any such distribution is more or less than the amount due to the Town, the amount of the overpayment or underpayment shall be certified to the Town Supervisor by the Comptroller, who shall not be held liable for any inaccuracy in such certification. The amount of the underpayment or overpayment shall be so certified to the Town Supervisor as soon after the discovery of the overpayment or underpayment as reasonably possible, and subsequent payments and distributions by the Comptroller to such Town shall be adjusted by subtracting the amount of any such overpayment from or by adding the amount of any such underpayment to such number of subsequent payments and distributions as the Comptroller and Town Supervisor shall consider reasonable in view of the underpayment or overpayment and all other facts and circumstances. 
E. All moneys received from the Comptroller by the Town Supervisor shall be deposited in the Community Housing Opportunity Fund established pursuant to Article I of this chapter. 
§ 162-2-61. through § 162-2-64. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-65. Judicial review. 
A. Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable under this article shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever, by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules if application therefor is made to the Supreme Court within four months after the giving of the notice of such final 
§ 162-2-65 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 162-2-70 
determination; provided, however, that any such proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall not be instituted unless: 
(1) 
The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and penalties thereon as may be provided for by this chapter, shall be first deposited and there is filed an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in New York State and approved by the State Superintendent of Insurance as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding shall be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or 

(2) 
At the option of the petitioner, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, interest and penalties stated in such determination, plus the costs and charges which may accrue against him in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a condition precedent to the application. 


B. Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally assessed or collected, and application for the refund or revision thereof duly made to the Comptroller, and such Comptroller shall have made a determination denying such refund or revision, such determination shall be reviewable by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules; provided, however, that: 
(1) 
Such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of the notice of such denial. 

(2) 
A final determination of tax due was not previously made. 

(3) 
An undertaking is filed with the Comptroller in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding is dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding. 


§ 162-2-66. through § 162-2-69. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-70. Apportionment of consideration subject to tax for property located only partly within Town. 
A. Where real property is situated partly within and partly without the boundaries of the Town, the consideration subject to tax is such part of the total consideration as is attributable to the portion of such real property situated within the Town or to the interest in such portion. If the consideration attributable to the property located in the Town is set forth in the contract, such amount may be used to compute the tax due. 
B. If the contract does not set forth the amount of consideration attributable to the portion of real property or interest therein situated within the Town, the consideration shall be reasonably allocated between the portion of such property or interest therein situated within the Town and the portion of such property or interest therein situated without the Town. If the grantor and the grantee enter into a written agreement, signed by both the grantor and the grantee, which sets forth a reasonable allocation of consideration, that allocation of consideration may be used to compute the tax due. If the grantor and the grantee do not enter into such an agreement, or if the allocation of consideration set forth in such agreement is deemed unreasonable by the Comptroller, the allocation of consideration must be computed by multiplying the amount of consideration by a fraction, the numerator of which is the fair market value of the real property or interest therein situated within the Town and the denominator of which is the total fair market value of all the real property or interest therein being conveyed. Except in the case of a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest where consideration means fair market value of the real property or interest therein, the tax shall be computed on the allocated portion of the actual consideration paid, even if that amount is greater or less than the fair market value as determined by appraisal. 
C. Where the methods provided under this section do not allocate the consideration in a fair and equitable manner, the Comptroller may require the grantor and grantee to allocate the consideration under such method as he prescribes, so long as the prescribed method results in a fair and equitable allocation. 
§ 162-2-71. through § 162-2-74. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-75. Determination of tax; petition to Town supervisor. 
A. If a return required by this article is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by the Comptroller from such records or information as may be obtainable, including the assessed valuation of the real property or interest therein and other appropriate factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within 90 days after the giving of notice of such determination, shall petition the Town Supervisor for a hearing, or unless the Comptroller, on the Comptroller's own motion, shall redetermine the same. The Town Supervisor may designate, in writing, a hearing officer to hear such an appeal, which hearing officer shall file a written report and recommendation with the Town Supervisor. In any case before the Town Supervisor under this article, the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner. After such hearing, the Town Supervisor shall give notice of the determination to the person against whom the tax is assessed and to the Comptroller. Such determination may be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of § 162-2-65 of this article. A proceeding for judicial review shall not be instituted unless: 
(1) 
The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the Comptroller and there shall be filed with the Comptroller an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in New York State and approved by the State Superintendent of Insurance as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding shall be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or 

(2) 
At the option of the petitioner, such undertaking filed with the Comptroller may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision, plus the costs and charges which may accrue against him in the prosecution of the proceeding; in which event, the petitioner shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the commencement of the 


§ 162-2-75 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 162-2-85 
proceeding. 
B. A person liable for the tax imposed by this article (whether or not a determination assessing a tax pursuant to Subsection A hereof has been made) shall be entitled to have the tax due finally and irrevocably fixed prior to the ninety-day period referred to in Subsection A by filing with the Comptroller a signed statement consenting thereto, in writing and in such form as the Comptroller shall prescribe. 
C. The remedies provided by this section and § 162-2-65 of this article shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this article. 
§ 162-2-76. through § 162-2-79. (Reserved) 
§ 162-2-80. Proceedings to recover tax due. 
A. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this article, the Town Attorney shall, upon the request of the Comptroller, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the Town, in any court of the State of New York or of any other state or of the United States. 
B. As an additional and alternative remedy, the Comptroller may issue a warrant, directed to the Sheriff of Suffolk County, commanding him to levy upon and sell any real and personal property of a grantor or grantee liable for the tax which may be found within the county, for payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty and interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the Comptroller and to pay the Comptroller the money collected by virtue thereof within 60 days after the receipt of the warrant. The Sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the Clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such Clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued. Such lien shall not apply to personal property unless such warrant is filed with the Department of State. The Sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant he shall be entitled to the same fees, which he may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the Comptroller, a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the county; and in the execution thereof, such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. Upon such filing of a copy of a warrant, the Comptroller shall have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the County of Suffolk had recovered the judgment therefor.

Chapter 171 
EAST HAMPTON CODE § 171-1 
MILLSTONE NUCLEAR POWER STATION - EMERGENCY PLANNING 
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 8-20-1999 by L.L. No. 31-1999, approved at referendum 11-2-1999. Amendments noted where applicable.] § 171-1. Findings and purpose. 
A. The Town Board hereby finds that under § 20 of the Executive Law, it is the responsibility of the State of New York to protect the public safety of its residents in the event of a natural or man-made disaster, including a radiological accident. Article 2-B of said law provides for the preparation of state and local disaster preparedness plans, including disaster prevention, disaster response and recovery. 
B. As a result of numerous public meetings held on eastern Long Island, the Town Board finds that the residents of the town have demonstrated legitimate public safety concerns with regard to the operation of the nuclear electric generating facilities in the nearby State of Connecticut. Specifically, the Millstone facilities in Waterford, Connecticut operate within a distance of 50 miles of where one-half million New Yorkers reside. Most parts of the Town of East Hampton is within a twenty-mile radius of this facility. 
C. Millstone has been closed seven times in recent months and has discharged radioactive water into Long Island Sound. It is clear this facility is not being operated safely and should be closed, pending a complete review of public health and safety issues. 
D. Existing United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations provide for a flexible ten-mile emergency planning zone. The exact size and configuration of the emergency planning zone in a particular case will be determined in relation to local emergency response needs and capabilities, including factors such as demography, topography, land characteristics, access routes and jurisdictional boundaries. These statutory criteria have not been applied to the special circumstances on Long Island as evidenced by the rigid ten-mile emergency planning zone for Millstone, which includes only Fishers Island within the State of New York. 
E. In the case of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station, it was the position of the State of New York and this town that all of eastern Long Island was required to be included within the emergency planning zone. It was also the policy that there was no safe evacuation plan that could be prepared and implemented that would adequately protect the public safety of eastern Long Island. As a result, the State of New York entered into an agreement with the Long Island Lighting Company, the operator of the facility, for its closure and dismantling. 
F. The Town Board finds that many of the same emergency response issues associated with Shoreham are also presented by Millstone. Specifically, the fact that the region is an island whose eastern ends are two long narrow forks presents unique evacuation issues. In addition, the area is characterized as a second home and tourist destination where the population more than triples during the summer months. The region is also immediately adjacent to the New York City metropolitan area with more than 10,000,000 people. Finally, its highway system is characterized by a single two-lane east-west highway route which would be the only major route for an evacuation. 
G. Based on these findings, the Town Board concludes that: 
(1) 
Millstone should be closed pending further study; 

(2) 
There must be an emergency planning zone of 50 miles from the Millstone facility for Long Island; 

(3) 
The feasibility of a safe evacuation plan must be studied; and 

(4) 
The approval or acceptance of such a plan must be subject to the strictest review. 



H. 
This local law is subject to a mandatory referendum because it limits the future authority of the elected Town Board. 


§ 171-2. Millstone closure. 
The Town Board hereby requests the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to close the Millstone Nuclear Power Station until the issues outlined in this local law relating to emergency planning zones and evacuation plans have been addressed and approved by the State of New York and its affected political subdivisions within 50 miles of the Millstone facility. 
§ 171-3. Establishment of fifty-mile emergency planning zone. 
The Town Board hereby requests the State of New York to file a petition with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to provide for a fifty-mile plume exposure pathway emergency planning zone for the benefit of eastern Long Island. 
§ 171-4. Emergency planning feasibility study. 
The Town Board hereby requests that the State of New York undertake the preparation of a report addressing the feasibility of a safe and implementable emergency plan for eastern Long Island within the fifty-mile radius in connection with the Millstone Nuclear Power Station. 
§ 171-5. Unanimous vote required. 
Any action by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton to approve, accept, implement or appropriate money in connection with an emergency plan in connection with the Millstone Nuclear Power Station will require a unanimous vote of the Town Board. 
§ 171-6. Proposition. 
Pursuant to § 23, Subdivision 2f, of the Municipal Home Rule Law, this local law curtails the power of the Town Board, thereby requiring a mandatory referendum. Therefore, the following proposition will be submitted to the electors of the Town of East Hampton at the general election to be held November 2, 1999: 
"Shall Local Law No. 31 of 1999, entitled 'A local law advocating the closure of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, requesting the State of New York to petition the United Nuclear Regulatory Commission to establish a fifty-mile plume exposure pathway emergency planning zone for Long Island in relation to said nuclear power station, requesting the State of New York to undertake a report of the feasibility of an emergency plan for Long Island in relation to said nuclear power station, and requiring a unanimous vote of the Town Board with regard to any town approval, acceptance, implementation, or appropriation in connection with an emergency plan for said nuclear power station' be approved?" 
§ 171-7 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 175-2 
§ 171-7. Severability. 
If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part of this local law shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered. 
§ 171-8. Effective date. 
This local law shall take effect after voter approval at the general election to be held November 2, 1999, by the affirmative vote of the qualified electors of the Town of East Hampton upon the proposition.

B. Collecting, reporting, and sharing Building Energy Benchmarking data on a regular basis allows municipal officials and the public to understand the energy performance of municipal buildings relative to similar buildings nationwide. Equipped with this information, the Town of East Hampton is able to make smarter, more cost-effective operational and capital investment decisions, reward efficiency, and drive widespread, continuous improvement. 
§ 175-2. Definitions.

General Provisions 
§ 204-1. Title. 
This chapter may be referred to as the "Town of East Hampton Recycling and Management of Solid Waste Law." 
§ 204-2. Legislative findings. 
The Town Board finds that: 
A. The reduction of the amount of solid waste and the conservation of recyclable materials are important public concerns. A significant amount of recyclable material that could be removed from the solid waste stream is needlessly discarded each year. 
B. The recovery and reuse of recyclable materials, such as newspaper, paper, cardboard, glass, cans, plastics and yard waste, will: 
(1) 
Protect and enhance the town's physical and visual environment. 

(2) 
Promote the health, safety and well-being of persons and property within the Town by reducing the town's reliance on other solid waste disposal methods. 

(3) 
Facilitate the implementation and operation of a cost-efficient and environmentally sound solid waste management program. 

(4) 
Conserve natural resources. 


C. The enactment by the state Legislature of the Solid Waste Management Act of 1988 has created the need for the Town to demonstrate its long-term commitment to effective waste management and requires the Town to enact appropriate legislation. The Town Board declares that the measures taken by the Town must establish the most environmentally sound and economically desirable waste reduction, recycling and reuse programs possible and should be consistent with or surpass the reduction, recycling and reuse goals established by New York State. 
D. Accordingly, the Town Board finds that to achieve these goals it is necessary to: 
(1) 
Establish a mandatory town-wide recycling program that provides opportunities for everyone in the Town to recycle; 

(2) 
Promote and increase the demand for recycled goods by all consumers, including the Town and its contractors; and 

(3) 
Encourage and support the use of the resources and skills of local existing and newly established recycling businesses and local community organizations and members in effectuating the recycling program. 


§ 204-3. Declaration of policy. 
It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the Town to reduce environmental pollution and dangers to health; dispose of solid waste generated within the Town in the most economical and environmentally acceptable manner, minimize the size and cost of the proposed solid waste

The rebate shall not be available in the case of the installation of a new sanitary system installed in connection with new construction or the substantial reconstruction of an existing building pursuant to a natural resources special permit or site plan approval where such permit or approval requires the upgrade of the sanitary system as a condition of the approval. Site plan approvals issued solely for the purpose of approving an upgrade to a sanitary system on nonresidential property shall not render the upgrade ineligible for the rebate. 

(3) 
In order to claim the rebate established by this chapter, an applicant must have actually paid the cost of the upgrades to the sanitary system. 

(4) 
Where the applicant owns more than one eligible property, there shall be authorized one rebate for each eligible sanitary system upgrade. 


B. Procedure for rebate. 
(1) In order to claim the rebate established by this section, the applicant must: 
(a) 
Submit a building permit application for the sanitary upgrade to the Town Building Inspector. In the event that site plan review and/or a natural resources special permit would be required for the upgrade, such approvals shall be obtained prior to commencement of the upgrade, and such permits will be processed on a expedited basis, provided the applicant does not seek approval to perform any other improvements on the property which would themselves require the issuance of either a natural resources special permit or site plan approval. Fees for the processing of a natural resources special permit, or a site plan application solely for the upgrade of the sanitary system shall be waived. 

(b) 
Obtain an inspection of the existing sanitary system by the Town Sanitation Inspector prior to commencement of any upgrade work, in order to certify that the applicant's existing system is a "substandard sanitary system" as the same is defined herein. Such inspection may require that the existing sanitary system be excavated in order to expose it for inspection. 

(c) 
Obtain an inspection of the upgraded sanitary system by the Town Sanitation Inspector prior to backfilling, in order to certify that the applicant has performed the work necessary to upgrade the substandard sanitary system. Upon 


verification that improvements have been properly installed to Suffolk County standards, and to the extent possible, the standards of the Town of East Hampton, the Building Inspector shall issue a compliance letter for the system. The compliance letter shall also include a notice to the applicant that applicable law requires that the sanitary system be maintained to Suffolk County standards in the future, and that any modifications, changes, alterations or future replacement systems will require the issuance of a new permit and shall be performed to the then-applicable Suffolk County and, to the extent possible, Town of East Hampton standards. 
(2) 
Upon issuance of the compliance letter by the Building Inspector, the applicant shall provide the Town Building Inspector with a notarized certification representing that the upgraded sanitary system will be maintained in proper operating condition from the date of installation, and further acknowledging the requirements that repairs, alterations, modifications or future replacements shall meet the then-applicable Town and Suffolk County standards. 

(3) 
The eligible individual shall then file a voucher with the Town to claim the rebate established by this section, in a manner prescribed by the Town Finance Department. The applicant shall document all costs associated with the upgrade. A copy of the compliance letter from the Town Building Inspector together with the applicant's certification shall also be attached to the voucher. 

(4) 
Payment of the rebate shall be made to the applicant after approval of the voucher by the Town Board and Town Finance Department. 


C. Amount of rebate. The rebate authorized for the upgrade of an existing sanitary system pursuant to the terms of this local law shall be $2,500 for upgrades to existing residential systems completed before 1981, and $4,000 for upgrades to existing systems installed before 1981 on commercial property. 
D. Rebate expiration date. The rebate established pursuant to this § 208-2 shall be paid to eligible individuals for the upgrade of sanitary systems completed on or before December 31, 2010. 
§ 208-3. Fund established. 
The Town Board of the Town of East Hampton hereby establishes a HPOD sanitary system upgrade capital project fund, for the purposes enumerated in this section. Deposits into the fund may include revenues of the Town from whatever source, including but not limited to, a) indebtedness or obligations incurred pursuant to the local finance law to effectuate the purposes of this section, b) general fund balances or surpluses, or c) any state or federal grants received by the Town. Interest accrued by monies deposited into the fund shall be credited to the fund. In no event shall monies deposited into the fund be transferred to any other account. Payment of the rebate shall be subject to appropriation. 
§ 208-4. Applicability. 
The provisions of this local law shall be applicable to all properties in the Town of East Hampton within the Harbor Protection Overlay District (HPOD) containing sanitary systems installed prior to 1981, excluding properties within incorporated villages. 
§ 208-5 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 209-1 
§ 208-5. Severability. 
If any provision of this local law or application thereof shall for any reason be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder of the local law, but shall be confined in its operation to the provision thereof directly involved in the controversy in which the judgment shall have been rendered. 
§ 208-6. Effective date. 
This local law shall become effective upon its filing in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of New York.

A. No person shall construct, alter, modify, repair or replace any sanitary system (including any septic tank or cesspool) located within the Town of East Hampton without having first obtained from the East Hampton Town Building Department: 
(1) 
A building permit for the new installation or expansion of a sanitary system; or 

(2) 
In the event of a proposed replacement of an existing system without any increase in capacity, or any proposed change of use of the premises upon which the system is located, an approved limited septic registry authorization. 


B. Such building permit or limited septic registry authorization shall state the exact location and address of the work in the manner and form specified by the Building Inspector. Any changes to the existing system shall be performed in accordance to plans reviewed and approved by the Building Inspector and in accordance with the building permit or limited septic registry authorization if applicable.

No building permit or other authorization for any such work shall issue until the Building Department determines that all applicable provisions of the Town Code, including provisions of Chapter 255, Zoning, have been complied with. [Amended 12-10-2019 by L.L. No. 36-2019] 
B. In addition to the conditions provided for in Subsection A, for all the following circumstances, the sanitary systems installed must be, or the current sanitary system must be upgraded to, a low-nitrogen sanitary system as defined in § 210-1-4:

§ 210-3-2 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 210-3-3 
issue an extension for compliance with the provisions of this section upon a showing of good cause. Good cause must be based upon a showing that compliance is impossible due to physical limitations and lack of an approved low-nitrogen sanitary system to address and accommodate such limitations. It is not good cause if a low-nitrogen sanitary system exists that would accommodate such limitations, but does not accommodate the site plan applicant's proposal to increase occupancy or use. Such extension shall not be granted until the Planning Board has received proof that the owner/applicant has recorded the following covenants and restrictions in the office of the Suffolk County Clerk. The covenants and restrictions must provide that: [Amended 12-10-2019 by L.L. No. 36-2019]

(2) 
The owner/applicant seeks an extension to comply with the provisions of this section; and 

(3) 
Upon approval of a low-nitrogen sanitary system that can accommodate the physical limitations of the property, or upon availability of a community sanitary system that the subject property can hook up to, the owner/applicant must install the low-nitrogen sanitary system or hook up to the community sanitary system within one year of the availability of such option; and 

(4) 
Failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions may subject the owner/ applicant to the penalties contained in the East Hampton Town Code, including, but not limited to, the revocation of the extension for compliance; and 

(5) 
This extension and these covenants and restriction run with the land, and to that end, all references herein to owner/applicant shall be deemed to also refer to owner/ applicant's successors in interest. 


D. Upon completion of the sanitary installation pursuant to a limited septic registry authorization, a certificate of compliance shall be issued for the sanitary system. [Added 12-10-2019 by L.L. No. 36-2019] 
E. Notwithstanding the issuance of a certificate of compliance, the Town shall have continued rights to inspect the system pursuant to Section § 210-5-1 hereof, "Required inspections," and to continue to receive information from the operations and maintenance entity pursuant to § 210-6-1.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding section or any provision to the contrary in Chapter 255, Zoning, of the Town Code, a limited septic registry authorization may be issued solely for the purpose of repairing, replacing or upgrading an existing system to a low-nitrogen sanitary system. If such system complies in all respects with the current standards and requirements of the Suffolk County Sanitary Code, has the approval of the Suffolk County Department of Health Services and meets all current Town Code setbacks, or is to be sited in the same location as the existing sanitary system, a limited septic registry authorization may issue without Town site plan review, special permit review, building permit or other local review and approval, provided such low-nitrogen system is not an expansion of the sanitary system capacity, does not increase the occupancy of the premises, and there is no proposed change in use of the premises which requires site plan review and/or other approvals. The Building inspector and/or Sanitation Inspector shall determine an applicant's compliance with the foregoing requirements. 
§ 210-3-4. Accessibility. [Amended 8-8-2017 by L.L. No. 28-2017] 
To the extent practicable and consistent with the preceding sections, all new construction of sanitary systems shall be located on a site so that inspection and maintenance of such systems can be carried out without excessive difficulty or trespass on the lands of another. Thereafter, new buildings, structures, landscaping, etc., shall not be constructed or located so as to restrict such free access. 
§ 210-3-5. Ability to inspect. [Amended 8-8-2017 by L.L. No. 28-2017] 
Unless forbidden in a particular case by the Department of Health Services, all sanitary systems shall be constructed in a manner that permits inspection of the system as provided for herein without the removal of large amounts of grass, dirt, landscaping or other material. 
§ 210-3-6. Fee for limited septic registry authorization. [Amended 8-8-2017 by L.L. No. 28-2017; 12-10-2019 by L.L. No. 36-2019]

It is the purpose of this article to provide for a uniform and orderly procedure for assessing lands for real property tax purposes which are subject to a conservation easement as provided for in Chapter 16 of this Code.

A. After acquisition by the Town of any conservation easement pursuant to Chapter 16 of this Code, the valuation placed upon such premises, parcel or property upon or from which such interest was granted, for the purposes of real estate taxation, shall take into account and be limited by the limitation placed on the future use of the land by the conservation easement.

§ 225-10. Penalties for violation or extinguishment. 
A. If there is substantial violation of the terms and conditions of the conservation easement or if said easement is extinguished, then the owner or owners of said property must pay to the Town of East Hampton the following amounts: 
(1) All taxes abated under the reduced assessment granted pursuant to this article due to the conservation easement; said taxes to include the state, county, town, school district and all special improvement districts and other taxing units to which the property is subject. The obligation to pay said taxes shall be limited as follows: 
(a) 
Any easement broken before its 11th year will be subject to a five-year maximum rollback of the date from which said taxes due shall be calculated. 

(b) 
Any easement broken between its 11th and 15th year will be subject to a four-year maximum rollback of the date from which said taxes due shall be calculated. 

(c) 
Any easement broken in its 16th year or later will be subject to a three-year maximum rollback of the date from which said taxes due shall be calculated, plus a penalty equal to the previous year's tax abatement multiplied by a factor equal to the term of the easement divided by the current year of the easement.

ARTICLE VIII 
Enhanced STAR Exemption Extension 
[Adopted 11-3-2006 by L.L. No. 29-2006; amended in its entirety 10-16-2014 by L.L. No. 35-2014] 
§ 225-28. Purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to give seniors who receive the enhanced STAR tax exemption and seniors age 65 and over receiving an exemption pursuant to § 425, Subdivision 4, or § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law an extra five days to pay their property taxes. The Board finds that many seniors depend on their social security check as their sole means of income. Seniors may find it difficult to make their property tax payments on the first of the month because of the delay in receiving their social security checks. This local law recognizes this deadline is tight and gives seniors more time to pay their bills while they are waiting for the social security checks. 
§ 225-29. Extension. 
Pursuant to the provisions of § 925-b of the New York State Real Property Tax Law, the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton authorizes an extension of no more than five business days for payment of taxes without interest or penalty for those residents who receive an enhanced STAR exemption pursuant to § 425, Subdivision 4, or § 467 of the New York State Real Property Tax Law. 
Chapter 226 TAXICABS AND VEHICLES FOR HIRE 
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 6-17-2010 by L.L. No. 4-2010; amended in its entirety 4-18-2013 by L.L. No. 1-2013. Subsequent amendments noted where applicable.]

§ 226-1. Purpose and intent. 
A. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the activities of taxicabs and other vehicles for hire in the Town of East Hampton. History and experience have shown that there is a need for investigation and review of the conduct of taxicab drivers and vehicles for hire in order to ensure the health, safety and welfare of residents and visitors within the Town. Indeed, one of the Town Board's highest priorities is to promote public safety, economic well­being, and highway safety and usage within the community while preserving the character of the community. 
B. The Town Board hereby declares that the transportation of persons by motor vehicles available for hire in the Town of East Hampton is a vital service which must be licensed and regulated in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of individuals using such services and the community as a whole. 
C. Thus, this chapter is intended to safeguard consumers against price gouging, fraud and inferior services; to prevent unsafe driving conditions on the public roads and highways of the Town; and to prohibit the pickup of passengers by taxicabs not licensed to do so in the Town of East Hampton. 
D. Because a variety of administrative costs will be incurred in connection with the issuance and recording of licenses, as yet undetermined in the regulation and enforcement of such licenses, the Board seeks to set all fees within this chapter by Town Board resolution. In doing so, the Board is able to better facilitate any necessary changes that may be required in the future. 
E. Town Law §§ 136 and 137, General Municipal Law § 181 and Municipal Home Rule Law § 10 provide authorization for this chapter.

§ 234-1. Title. 
This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Vegetation Protection Ordinance of the Town of East Hampton." 
§ 234-2. Purpose. 
The Town Board of the Town of East Hampton finds that trees and other vegetation perform numerous important and essential functions, including but not limited to the stabilization and preservation of soil; maintenance of watershed areas which are essential to the town's freshwater supply; absorption of air pollution and production of oxygen; establishment of natural barrier to noise and habitats for wildlife; and creation of a desirable aesthetic quality which is a key factor in the town's existence as a rural resort community. The Town Board further finds that the destruction or removal of trees and other vegetation deprives all sectors of society of these benefits, while disrupting ecological systems of which they are an integral part, and that regulation of such destruction or removal will protect and preserve property within the town and promote the general welfare and health of its inhabitants. 
§ 234-3. Definitions. 
As used in this ordinance, unless the context requires otherwise, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: PERSON  Shall not include any governmental body or subdivision or agent thereof. VEGETATION  Includes trees, shrubs, bushes, grasses, flowers and similar plant life.

Where such express prior written consent has been obtained, the person to whom the same was given shall keep such consent on his person and available for immediate display at all times during such activity pertaining to vegetation as set forth herein. Such express prior written consent shall not be deemed a consent hereunder as to any person whose name is not set forth therein. Failure to produce such express prior written consent upon demand therefor by any peace or police officer shall be presumptive evidence that such consent has not been given or received. 
B. On any public grounds or property, reserved areas and common recreation areas within the town, outside incorporated villages, without the express written authorization of the Town Board or its duly designated agent. The provisions of Subsection A of this section applicable to express prior written consents shall be applicable to Town Board authorization under this subsection.

If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause, phrase or provision of this ordinance shall be adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional, the same shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part or provision hereof other than the part so adjudged to be invalid or unconstitutional.

A special motor vehicle registration and one set of disabled person vehicle identification plates (as defined in § 404-a of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and distributed by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to handicapped persons and to noncommercial vans used to transport handicapped persons). 


B. In establishing penalties for illegal parking in handicapped spaces, the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law distinguishes among vehicles parking in off-street parking spaces provided by a shopping center or facility with at least five separate retail stores and 20 off-street parking spaces (see § 1203-c of the Vehicle and Traffic Law); vehicles stopped, standing or parking on public streets in designated handicapped parking spaces (see § 1203-b of the Vehicle and Traffic Law); and vehicles stopped, standing or parked on certain private streets, roadways, driveways and/or parking lots that are subject to regulation following enactment of local legislation (see § 1660-a of the Vehicle and Traffic 
§ 240-105 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 240-109 
Law and Chapter 240, Article XI, of the East Hampton Town Code). 
(1) 
Off-street handicapped parking spaces. Section 1203-c of the Vehicle and Traffic Law sets forth the fines that can be imposed against a person convicted of illegally parking in a handicapped parking space. Said § 1203-c further provides that a Town may, by local law, impose a larger maximum fine. 

(2) 
Handicapped parking spaces on public streets and on certain private areas designated by local law. Section 1800 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law provides the amount of fines and the length of imprisonment that can be imposed against a person convicted of illegally parking in a handicapped parking space. Said § 1800 further provides that a Town may prescribe additional fines by local law. 


§ 240-106. Program fines. 
Any person who parks in a space clearly marked for use by the handicapped without a special municipal parking permit or whose vehicle lacks a special motor vehicle registration and one set of disabled person vehicle identification plates and whose vehicle is not being used for the transportation of a handicapped person shall be subject to a program fine of $250 for the first offense and $350 for any subsequent offense committed within 18 months within the same municipality. 
§ 240-107. Disposition of fines. 
The proceeds of the program fines collected pursuant to this article shall be placed in a reserve fund as provided for in Article 2 of New York State General Municipal Law and shall be used for the sole purpose(s) of enhancing handicapped facilities and programs in the Town and Village of East Hampton and, additionally, to reimburse both the Town and village for training, maintenance and administrative costs related to implementation of this program. 
§ 240-108. Severability. 
The provisions of this law are declared to be severable. If any section, sentence, clause or phrase thereof shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining sections, sentences, clauses or phrases of this law, but they shall remain in effect, it being the legislative intent that this law shall stand notwithstanding the invalidity of any part.

§ 16-2. Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
CONSERVATION EASEMENT  An easement, covenant, restriction or other interest in real property which limits or restricts development, management or use of such real property for the purpose of preserving or maintaining the scenic, open, natural or existing character, condition, significance or amenities of the real property. 
DEVELOPMENT  The process of converting a tract of land to a specific purpose either through man-made physical changes to the real estate or by making application for permits or approvals from local, county, state or federal government agencies for permission or approval to improve, convert or otherwise change the physical or legal status of the property. Pursuant to this chapter, when a conservation easement provides that the subject property shall not be developed, such proscription shall specifically include, but not be limited to, making application to the Town for a subdivision, subdivision waiver, site plan approval, special permit or building permit. 
OPEN SPACE OR OPEN AREA  Any lands or waters within the Town characterized by natural scenic beauty or whose open character, natural condition or present state, if retained, would enhance the present or potential value of adjacent, surrounding or nearby lands or development or would maintain or enhance the conservation of natural, cultural or scenic resources. For the purposes of this chapter, natural resources shall include but not be limited to agricultural lands as open lands suitable for use in bona fide agricultural production. 
§ 16-3. Procedure for granting and acceptance of conservation easements. 
A. Local agency approval. Where the easement is offered to the Town pursuant to a condition or requirement of an approval or permit granted to the owner of the affected property by an agency or board of the town, the Town Board may accept such grant of an easement after a public hearing held upon due notice as provided for in § 247, Subdivision 2, of the General Municipal Law. 
B. Proposal by owner. Any owner or owners of land may, on their own initiative, offer to grant a conservation easement to the town. Where such a grant of an easement is offered to the town, the Town Board shall, before taking any action, refer the matter to the Town Planning Department for its recommendation. The Planning Department shall review the proposed easement and investigate the areas or lands covered by the easement to determine if the proposal would be of benefit to the people of the Town of East Hampton by furthering the purposes set forth in this chapter. In formulating its recommendation, the Planning Department may consult with or solicit the advice of any other agency or department of the Town or with any bona fide nonprofit conservation organization having particular or special knowledge of the areas or lands covered by the proposed easement. The Planning Department shall submit its findings and recommendations to the Town Board in writing. Upon receipt of such recommendation, the Town Board may accept such grant of an easement if it determines, after a public hearing held upon due notice as provided for in § 247, Subdivision 2, of the General Municipal Law, that it is in the public interest and would further the purposes set forth in this chapter. 
§ 16-4. Minimum form and content of easements. 
A. All conservation easements accepted by the Town Board pursuant to § 16-3 of this chapter shall be in a form acceptable to the Town Attorney but at a minimum shall meet the following standards:

(3) 
Conservation easements must have a minimum term of five years. There shall be no maximum term; all easements shall be perpetual in duration unless otherwise provided in such instrument. 

(4) 
In the case of agricultural easements suitable for agricultural production as defined in § 301 of the Agriculture and Markets Law of the State of New York, the grantor must covenant and agree that the land under the easement will not be developed, built upon or otherwise changed during the term of the conservation easement except that agricultural operations shall be permitted. 

(5) 
In all other cases, the grantor must agree that the land under the easement will not be developed, built upon, cleared or otherwise disturbed or changed during the term of the conservation easement, except that bona fide conservation management measures may be permitted pursuant to a conservation plan approved by the Director of Environmental Protection of the Town. 

(6) 
Land covered by a conservation easement may be sold, but the terms and conditions of the conservation easement shall run with the land and shall continue for the term of the easement. 


B. Where the parcel covered by the conservation easement contains a principal dwelling or other buildings and structures, said dwelling, buildings or structures shall be excepted from the conservation easement unless the instrument, by its terms, expressly applies to such dwelling, building or structure. 
§ 16-5. Modification, alienation and termination. 
The Town Board of the Town of East Hampton may not modify, alienate or terminate any easement granted to the Town of East Hampton, whether pursuant to this chapter or under the provisions of § 247 of the General Municipal Law or Title 3 of the Environmental Conservation Law, unless a proposition to do so has been approved by the electors of the Town of East Hampton at a special or biennial Town election. 
§ 16-6. Violations. 
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to violate the terms of any conservation easement granted to the Town of East Hampton.

Any such order shall specify a reasonable time for the completion of such restoration, which shall be effected under the supervision of the approving authority. 
C. After the date on which the Building Inspector, Ordinance Enforcement Officer, or other responsible Town official shall have provided notice of a violation or a stop-work order to the offender, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.

D. Elevation certificate required. For all construction occurring within the Flood Hazard Overlay District, as defined by § 255-3-40 of Chapter 255, Zoning, and subject to the construction and design standards set forth therein, upon placement of the lowest floor or floodproofing by whatever means or upon placement of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever applies, the permit holder shall submit to the Building Inspector an elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor, floodproofed elevation or the elevation of the lowest portion of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is applicable, as built, in relation to mean sea level.

The Building Inspector shall review and approve all such certificates. Deficiencies in construction or floodproofing or failure to meet the minimum first-floor elevation shall be cause for issuance of a stop-work order for the project unless immediately corrected.

A certificate of occupancy shall be issued, where appropriate, within 30 days after application therefor is made. Failure to act upon such application within 30 days shall constitute approval of such application and the building or portion thereof may thereafter be occupied as though a certificate of occupancy has been issued. 

(3) 
The certificate of occupancy shall certify that the work has been completed, and that the proposed use and occupancy is in conformity with the provisions of the applicable building laws, ordinances and regulations, and shall specify the use or uses and the extent thereof to which the building or structure or its several parts may be put. 

(4) 
The Town Board shall set the fee for issuance of a certificate of occupancy from time to time by resolution. 


B. Revocation of certificate of occupancy. 
(1) 
The Building Inspector may revoke a certificate of occupancy theretofore issued and approved in the following instances: 

(a) 
Where he finds that there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application, plans or specifications upon which the building permit was issued; 

(b) 
Where he finds that there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application for a certificate of occupancy; 

(c) 
Where he finds that the certificate of occupancy was issued in error; or 

(d) 
Where he finds that the issuance of the certificate of occupancy is in conflict with the applicable law. 



(2) 
Revocation of the certificate of occupancy is not effective until the Building Inspector refers revocation of a certificate of occupancy to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a hearing and determination on the merits and such determination is filed with the office of the Town Clerk. 


§ 102-17. Temporary certificate of occupancy. 
Upon request, the Building Inspector may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a building or structure, or part thereof, provided that the Inspector finds that such portion or portions as have been completed may be occupied safely without endangering life or the public welfare. A temporary certificate of occupancy can only be issued by the Building Inspector when the outstanding work to be performed by the applicant concerns paving and sidewalk improvements, or landscaping or revegetation work that cannot be completed due to seasonal climatic conditions. A temporary certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to this section shall expire within 90 days. The Building Inspector may, in his or her discretion, approve a ninety-day extension of the temporary certificate of occupancy for good cause. 
§ 102-18 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 102-18.1 
§ 102-18. Tests. 
Whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that any material, construction, equipment or assembly does not conform with the requirements of the applicable building laws, ordinances or regulations, the Building Inspector may require the same to be subjected to tests in order to furnish proof of such compliance. 
§ 102-18.1. Unsafe buildings. 
A. All buildings or structures which are structurally unsafe, unsanitary, or not provided with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to safety or health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment are, severally, for the purpose of this section, unsafe buildings. All such unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be illegal and shall be abated by repair and rehabilitation or by demolition in accordance with the procedure of this section. 
B. The Building Inspector shall examine or cause to be examined every building reported as unsafe or damaged, and shall make a written record of such examination. 
C. Whenever the Building Inspector shall find any building, or structure, or portion thereof to be an unsafe building as defined in this section, he shall, in the same manner as provided for the service of stop orders in § 102-11 of this ordinance, give to the owner, agent, or person in control of such building or structure written notice stating the defects thereof. This notice shall require the owner within a stated time either to complete specified repairs or improvements, or to demolish and remove the building, or structure or portion thereof. 
D. If the Building Inspector finds that there is actual and immediate danger of failure or collapse so as to endanger life, such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the specified repairs and improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the Building Official. The Building Inspector shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such building a notice "This building is unsafe and its use or occupancy has been prohibited by the Building Department." Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs are made or demolition is completed. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation, or their agents or other servants to remove such notice without written permission of the Building Inspector, or for any person to enter the building except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing same. 
E. In case the owner, agent, or person in control cannot be found within the stated time limit, or if such owner, agent or person in control shall fail, neglect, or refuse to comply with notice to repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove said building, or structure, or portion thereof, the Town Counsel shall be advised of all the facts in the case, and shall institute an appropriate action in the courts to compel compliance. 
F. In cases of emergency which, in the opinion of the Building Inspector, involve imminent danger to human life or health, he shall promptly cause such buildings, structures, or portions thereof to be made safe or removed. For this purpose he may at once enter such structure or land on which it stands, or abutting land or structure, with such assistance and at such costs as may be necessary. He may vacate adjacent structures and protect the public by appropriate barricades or such other means as may be necessary, and for this purpose 
may close a public or private way. 
G. Costs incurred under Subsections E and F of this section shall be paid out of the municipal treasury on certificate of the Building Inspector. Such costs shall be charged to the owner of the premises involved and shall be collected in the manner provided by law. 
§ 102-19. Notification regarding fire or explosion. 
The chief of any fire department providing fire-fighting services for a property within the Town of East Hampton shall promptly notify the Building Inspector of any fire or explosion involving any structural damage, fuel-burning appliance, chimney, or gas vent.

(1) 
The request of the owner of the property to be inspected or an authorized agent of such owner. 

(2) 
Receipt by the Building Inspector or any other individual designated in § 102-4A(1) of a written statement alleging that conditions or activities failing to comply with the Uniform Code or Energy Code exist. 

(3) 
Receipt by the Building Inspector or any other individual designated in § 102-4A(1) of any other information, reasonably believed by the Building Inspector or any other individual designated in § 102-4A(1) to be reliable, giving rise to reasonable cause to believe that conditions or activities failing to comply with the Uniform Code or Energy Code exist; provided, however, that nothing in this Subsection B(3) shall be construed as permitting an inspection under any circumstances under which a court order or warrant permitting such inspection is required, unless such court order or warrant shall have been obtained.

§ 102-20 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 102-24 Administrator under Executive Law Section 156-e and Education Law Section 807-b. 
§ 102-21. Penalties for violation. 
A. Any violation of the Uniform Code or Energy Code shall be considered a violation of this chapter. 
B. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter, including the failure, refusal, or neglect to comply with an order issued by the Building Inspector, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable for a first offense by a fine of not less than $250 and not to exceed $1,000 or a term of imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both; for a second offense, by a fine of not less than $1,000 and not to exceed $3,000 or a term of imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both; and for a third or subsequent offense within a five year period, by a fine of not less than $5,000 and not to exceed $10,000 or a term of imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both.

D. The owner and person in control of any building or premises or part thereof, where any violation of this ordinance has been committed or shall exist, shall each be guilty of a separate offense and upon conviction thereof shall be fined and/or imprisoned as herein provided. For the purposes of this article, "person in control" is defined as any owner, builder, architect, lessee, tenant, contractor, subcontractor, construction superintendent or their agents or any other person taking part or assisting in the construction, maintenance or use of any structure, building or property, so long as such person or entity has the apparent power and authority to control the manner in which the structure, building or property is constructed, maintained or used. [Amended 7-21-2016 by L.L. No. 33-2016] 
E. In addition to the above penalty, any appropriate action or proceeding may be instituted or taken to prevent any unlawful construction, erection, alteration, repair, maintenance, or use or to restrain, correct or abate any violation or to prevent the occupancy of any such building, structure, or premises or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such building, structure, or premises. 
§ 102-22. Abatement of violation. 
Appropriate actions and proceedings may be taken at law or in equity to prevent unlawful construction or to restrain, correct or abate a violation or to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises or to prevent illegal acts, conduct or business in or about any premises; and those remedies shall be in addition to the penalties prescribed in the preceding section. 
§ 102-23. Application. 
This ordinance shall be effective and operative only in that portion of the Town of East Hampton outside of any incorporated village therein. 
§ 102-24. East Hampton Town Energy Savings Program. [Amended 2-16-2017 by L.L. No. 6-2017; 12-6-2022 by L.L. No. 32-2022] 
A. The NYStretch Energy Code 2020 supplement to the Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State 2020, (hereafter referred to as "NYStretch") published by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (hereafter referred to as "NYSERDA"), shall be effective for all building permit applications (applicable to new construction, substantial reconstruction, alterations, and additions) submitted on or after January 1, 2023, in the Town of East Hampton unless superseded by more restrictive provisions adopted herein by the Town of East Hampton or by New York State except that Section R403.6.2 of the NYStretch Code shall be severed from this local law and not be applicable. 
B. Effective June 1, 2017, any newly built or substantially reconstructed subject dwelling detached one-or two-family dwelling shall be rated by an independent, Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET)-certified home energy rating system (HERS) rater, following the protocol set out by RESNET, including all required reviews, inspections, and diagnostic tests, including combustion safety tests. The HERS rater must attest that the home was rated to the HERS index prescribed below, passed all combustion safety tests, and complies with all requirements of Section R406 of the ECCCNYS 2020 as amended by NYStretch 2020 prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(1) 
Detached one-or two-family dwellings up to 3,000 square feet Gross Floor Area (GFA) shall meet the requirements of either the Prescriptive Path, or Performance Path, or achieve an Energy Rating Index (ERI) of 50 or less and comply with all requirements of Section R406 of the ECCNYS 2020 as amended NYStretch 2020. 

(2) 
Detached one-or two-family dwellings with 3,001 to 4,500 square feet Gross Floor Area (GFA) shall achieve an Energy Rating Index (ERI) of 50 or less and comply with all requirements of Section R406 of the ECCCNYS 2020 as amended NYStretch 2020. 

(3) 
Detached one-or two-family dwellings with over 4,500 square feet Gross Floor Area (GFA) shall achieve an Energy Rating Index (ERI) of 31 or less and comply with all requirements of Section R406 of the ECCCNYS 2020 as amended by NYStretch 2020. In addition, the building envelope must be at least as efficient as the prescriptive requirements of the 2020 NYStretch Energy Code. 


C. For the sole purpose of identifying with which of the requirements of Subsection B a subject dwelling must comply, the Gross Floor Area (GFA) as defined by "floor area, gross" in § 255-1-20 of the East Hampton Town Code will be used. GFA does not supersede the methodology of current RESNET protocol, but serves only to trigger the compliance tier required of a newly built or substantially reconstructed subject dwelling. 
D. Effective January 1, 2023, new multifamily buildings shall also be in compliance with the provisions of this Code, unless the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector has determined otherwise based upon a formal written request of the property owner. Upon receipt of a formal written request, the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector shall determine whether the relief from strict compliance to the standards enumerated in Subsection B above is justified. In making a determination as to whether practical difficulties justify a waiver from strict compliance to the standards set forth in this Code, the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector shall consider the following factors: the location and condition of any existing structure or structures, the size of the lot, the topography of the lot, the existence and extent of clearing restrictions on the property, the proximity of trees and shade on the lot, lot coverage restrictions on the property and such 
§ 102-24 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 102-24 
other and further factors or conditions that exist at the property that may impact strict compliance with the standards enumerated in Subsection B above. If the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector determines that a waiver is appropriate, the property owner shall provide a practicable plan for alternative methods of energy conservation conducive for the location or make a showing that there are no practicable energy conservation systems conducive to the location. Upon receipt of the property owner's plan, the Principal and/ or Chief Building inspector shall grant a waiver, in writing, from the requirements of this section, conditioned upon the implementation of the alternative methods proposed by the owner or such other practicable conditions as required by the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector. This downgraded home energy rating application is to the Town for a waiver of the Town's requirements. Receipt of an approved waiver from the Town does not allow for the state's requirement to not be met. A separate application to the state would need to be made if the state standard is not being met. 
E. Effective January 1, 2023, commercial buildings may also comply with Appendices CB (Rated R-Value of Insulation -Commercial) of the 2020 NYStretch Energy Code when applicable, and must comply with Appendix CC (Additional Power Distribution System Packages) of the 2020 NYStretch Energy Code when applicable. 
F. Effective January 1, 2023, additions and alterations that are not deemed substantial reconstruction to residential and commercial buildings shall comply with Chapter 5 of the ECCCNYS 2020 as modified by NYStretch 2020. Compliance of additions and alterations to residential buildings shall be documented and verified by an independent, Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET)-certified home energy rating system (HERS) rater. 
G. The owner of a structure may apply for a waiver from the requirements of this section on the basis that the structure is of historic significance. The owner seeking a waiver shall make application to the Town Architectural Review Board for such waiver. The Architectural Review Board shall grant the application for the waiver if the applicant shall demonstrate that meeting the requirements of this section would have an adverse impact on the historical nature of the structure, and there are no practicable alternatives that would allow the applicant to comply with the requirements of this section and maintain the historical significance of the structure. 
H. The owner of a structure or proposed structure may apply for a downgraded home energy rating requirement by written application to the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector on the basis that there exists practicable difficulties specific to the site, construction or design elements encountered in the course of design or construction. Upon receipt of the written request, the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector shall determine whether there is a showing of need for relief from strict compliance to the standards enumerated in Subsection B above. In determining the conduciveness of a property and practicable difficulties, the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector shall consider the following factors: the location and condition of any existing structure or structures, the size of the lot, the topography of the lot, the existence and extent of clearing restrictions on the property, the proximity of trees and shade on the lot, lot coverage restrictions on the property and such other and further factors or conditions that exist at the property that may impact strict compliance with the standards enumerated in Subsection B above. If the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector determines that a waiver is appropriate, the property owner shall provide a practicable plan for alternative methods of energy conservation conducive for the location or make a showing that there are no practicable energy conservation systems conducive to the location. Upon receipt of the property owner's plan, the Principal and/or Chief Building inspector shall grant a waiver, in writing, from the requirements of this section, conditioned upon the implementation of the alternative methods proposed by the owner or such other practicable conditions as required by the Principal and/or Chief Building Inspector. 
§ 102-24A. Appeal of Principal Building Inspector's determination. [Added 2-16-2017 by L.L. No. 6-2017] 
Any applicant aggrieved by a decision made by the Principal Building Inspector under § 102-24 above may appeal such decision, denial, condition, or waiver of the Principal Building Inspector by filing a written petition, along with a fee in an amount as set by resolution of the East Hampton Town Board, in the office of the Town Clerk for review to the Energy Conservation Administrative Appeals Board (hereinafter referred to as "ECAAB"). The ECAAB shall be comprised of the following persons: 1) Environmental Protection Director; 2) Town Engineer; 
3) Chair of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The ECAAB shall meet to review the petition within two weeks of receipt thereof and may hold hearings upon seven days' notice by certified mail to the applicant or his agent, at the address included in the petition. The ECAAB may conduct field visits and obtain additional information deemed necessary in rendering its decision. The ECAAB shall have the authority to hire independent consultants at its sole discretion to help it render a decision by undertaking actions including, but not limited to, review of plans, conduction of site testing, and modeling of proposed plans. The ECAAB may require an applicant to pay the costs incurred by the ECAAB for all independent consulting services it may reasonably seek to engage, including but not limited to engineering, planning, legal and clerical costs incurred in processing and review of an application. Upon completion of the review of the appeal or the close of the public hearing, the ECAAB shall issue a decision in writing and state the reasons and attendant conditions of its decision. A decision shall be issued within 45 days of the end of the hearing or completion of review.

Such credit shall be computed by multiplying the tax paid on the creation of the leasehold or on the granting of the option or contract by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the consideration used to compute such tax paid which is not yet due to such grantor on the date of the subsequent conveyance (and which such grantor will not be entitled to receive after such date) and the denominator of which is the total value of the consideration used to compute such tax paid.

In determining the tax on a conveyance described in Subsection A(1) above, a credit shall be allowed for a proportionate part of the amount of any tax paid upon the conveyance to the cooperative housing corporation of the real property comprising the cooperative dwelling or dwellings to the extent that such conveyance 


effectuated a mere change of identity or form of ownership of such property and not a change in the beneficial ownership of such property.

In no event, however, shall such credit reduce the tax on a conveyance described in Subsection A(1) below zero, nor shall any such credit be allowed for a tax paid more than 24 months prior to the date on which occurs the first in a series of conveyances of shares of stock in an offering of cooperative housing corporation shares described in Subsection A(1).

Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally assessed or collected, and application for the refund or revision thereof duly made to the Treasurer, and such Treasurer shall have made a determination denying such refund or revision, such determination shall be reviewable by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules; provided, however, that: 
(1) 
Such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of the notice of such denial. 

(2) 
A final determination of tax due was not previously made.

§ 112-2-76. through § 112-2-79. (Reserved) 
§ 112-2-80. Apportionment of consideration subject to tax for property located only partly within town. 
A. Where real property is situated partly within and partly without the boundaries of the town, the consideration subject to tax is such part of the total consideration as is attributable to the portion of such real property situated within the Town or to the interest in such portion. If the consideration attributable to the property located in the Town is set forth in the contract, such amount may be used to compute the tax due. 
B. If the contract does not set forth the amount of consideration attributable to the portion of real property or interest therein situated within the town, the consideration shall be reasonably allocated between the portion of such property or interest therein situated within the Town and the portion of such property or interest therein situated without the town. If the grantor and the grantee enter into a written agreement, signed by both the grantor and the grantee, which sets forth a reasonable allocation of consideration, that allocation of consideration may be used to compute the tax due. If the grantor and the grantee do not 
§ 112-2-80 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 112-2-85 
enter into such an agreement, or if the allocation of consideration set forth in such agreement is deemed unreasonable by the Treasurer, the allocation of consideration must be computed by multiplying the amount of consideration by a fraction, the numerator of which is the fair market value of the real property or interest therein situated within the Town and the denominator of which is the total fair market value of all the real property or interest therein being conveyed. Except in the case of a transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest where consideration means fair market value of the real property or interest therein, the tax shall be computed on the allocated portion of the actual consideration paid, even if that amount is greater or less than the fair market value as determined by appraisal. 
C. Where the methods provided under this section do not allocate the consideration in a fair and equitable manner, the Treasurer may require the grantor and grantee to allocate the consideration under such method as he prescribes, so long as the prescribed method results in a fair and equitable allocation. 
§ 112-2-81. through § 112-2-84. (Reserved) 
§ 112-2-85. Determination of tax; petition to Town Supervisor. 
A. If a return required by this article is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by the Treasurer from such records or information as may be obtainable, including the assessed valuation of the real property or interest therein and other appropriate factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within 90 days after the giving of notice of such determination, shall petition the Town Supervisor for a hearing, or unless the Treasurer, on the Treasurer's own motion, shall redetermine the same. The Town Supervisor may designate, in writing, a hearing officer to hear such an appeal, which hearing officer shall file a written report and recommendation with the Town Supervisor. In any case before the Town Supervisor under this article, the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner. After such hearing, the Town Supervisor shall give notice of the determination to the person against whom the tax is assessed and to the Treasurer. Such determination may be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of § 112-2-75 of this article. A proceeding for judicial review shall not be instituted unless: 
(1) 
The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the Treasurer and there shall be filed with the Treasurer an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in New York State and approved by the State Superintendent of Insurance as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding shall be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or 

(2) 
At the option of the petitioner, such undertaking filed with the Treasurer may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision, plus the costs and charges which may accrue against him in the prosecution of the proceeding; in which event, the petitioner shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the commencement of the 


proceeding. 
B. A person liable for the tax imposed by this article (whether or not a determination assessing a tax pursuant to Subsection A hereof has been made) shall be entitled to have the tax due finally and irrevocably fixed prior to the ninety-day period referred to in Subsection A by filing with the Treasurer a signed statement consenting thereto, in writing and in such form as the Treasurer shall prescribe. 
C. The remedies provided by this section and § 112-2-75 of this article shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this article. 
§ 112-2-86. through § 112-2-89. (Reserved) 
§ 112-2-90. Proceedings to recover tax due. 
A. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this article, the Town Attorney shall, upon the request of the Treasurer, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the town, in any court of the State of New York or of any other state or of the United States. 
B. As an additional and alternative remedy, the Treasurer may issue a warrant, directed to the Sheriff of Suffolk County, commanding him to levy upon and sell any real and personal property of a grantor or grantee liable for the tax which may be found within the county, for payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty and interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the Treasurer and to pay the Treasurer the money collected by virtue thereof within 60 days after the receipt of the warrant. The Sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the Clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such Clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued. Such lien shall not apply to personal property unless such warrant is filed with the Department of State. The Sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant he shall be entitled to the same fees, which he may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the Treasurer, a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the county; and in the execution thereof, such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. Upon such filing of a copy of a warrant, the Treasurer shall have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the County of Suffolk had recovered the judgment therefor. 
§ 112-2-91. through § 112-2-94. (Reserved) 
§ 112-2-95. Interest and civil penalties. 
A. Any grantor or grantee failing to file a return or to pay any tax within the time required by this article shall be subject to a penalty of 10% of the amount of the tax due plus an interest penalty of 2% of such amount, for each month of delay or fraction thereof after the expiration of the first month after such return was required to be filed or such tax became due; such interest penalty shall not exceed 25% in the aggregate. If the Treasurer determines that such failure or delay was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful 
§ 112-2-95 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 112-2-100 
neglect, the Treasurer shall remit, abate or waive all of such penalty and interest penalty. 
B. If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed in § 112-2-25 hereof for payment, interest on such amount at the rate of 10% per month shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid. 
C. The penalties and interest provided for in this section shall be paid to the Treasurer and shall be determined, assessed, collected and distributed in the same manner as the tax imposed by this article, and any reference to tax in this article shall be deemed to include the penalties and interest imposed in this section. 
§ 112-2-96. through § 112-2-99. (Reserved) 
§ 112-2-100. Confidentiality of transfer tax returns. 
A. Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for any officer or employee of the town, or any person engaged or retained on an independent contract basis, to divulge or make known in any manner the particulars set forth or disclosed in any return required under this article. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the recording officer from making a notation on an instrument effecting a conveyance indicating the amount of tax paid. No recorded instrument effecting a conveyance shall be considered a return for the purposes of this section. 
B. The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the Town in any action or proceeding involving the collection of a tax due under this article to which the Town or an officer or employee of the Town is a party or a claimant, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this article when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding; in any of which events the court may require the production of and may admit in evidence so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. 
C. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a grantor or grantee of an instrument effecting a conveyance, or to the duly authorized representative of such grantor or grantee, of a certified copy of any return filed in connection with such instrument or to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns or the items thereof or to prohibit the inspection by the legal representatives of the Town of the return of any taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon. 
D. Any officer or employee of the Town who willfully violates the provisions of this section shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office in the state for a period of five years thereafter.

§ 112-3-2. Community Preservation Project Plan adopted. 
For the reasons set forth in Section I83 hereof, the Town Board hereby approves and adopts the "Community Preservation Project Plan,"84 as amended, prepared by the Town Planning Department and Land Acquisition and Management Department dated August 19, 2021, said plan being intended to constitute, in its revised form, the Community Preservation Project Plan which is required by § 64-e of the New York Town Law and Article I ("Community Preservation Fund") of the East Hampton Town Code.

The Review Board shall meet only on an as-needed basis and shall not hold public hearings. 
B. Upon referral of an initial application or verification from the Town Clerk, the Review Committee shall inform the applicant in writing that they are reviewing the request, and give the applicant an opportunity to be heard. The Review Board may also make inquiries of the Town Attorney, Fire Marshal, Police Department and/or Code Enforcement with regard to circumstances of the violations. In reviewing initial applications and verifications, the Review Board shall consider the severity of the convictions, the relevance to the establishment hosting music entertainment, and any actions taken to avoid violations. The Board may consider remedial actions taken, actions of third parties, and any other relevant information. 
§ 117-60 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 117-90 
C. The permit holder will be notified of the determination of the Review Board, in writing, within 15 days of the determination. Such determination will remain on file in the office of the Town Clerk. The determinations of the Review Board shall be final but do not preclude an establishment or owner from applying for a permit the next permit year, subject to a new review by the Review Board at that time. Once the Review Board approves the issuance of a permit, the permit holder is eligible for verification by the Town Clerk so long as they do not subsequently receive three or more convictions as described in § 117-30H above. 
D. Should ownership of an establishment change after the issuance of three convictions but prior to a final determination of the Review Board with respect to those convictions, the new owner may only obtain a music entertainment permit after review by the Review Board. Similarly, all modifications and limitations of a permit as set forth by the Review Board shall be binding on subsequent owners. However, an owner may seek to remove any limitation or modification of a permit by request to the Review Board. 
§ 117-70. Violations. 
A. It shall be a violation of this chapter to play or permit to be played any music in a bar/tavern or restaurant without a music entertainment permit. 
B. It shall be a violation of this chapter to play or permit to be played any music in a bar/tavern or restaurant in violation of a permit that has been suspended pending judicial determination of summonses or in violation of the terms set forth by the Town Board after a hearing pursuant to § 117-60. 
§ 117-80. Penalties for offenses. 
Any person found guilty of a violation of any of the provisions of this local law shall, upon conviction, be deemed guilty of an offense, which shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000, nor more than $5,000, or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed 15 days, or both such fine and imprisonment. 
§ 117-90. Severability. 
Should any section or provision of this local law be decided by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the local law as a whole or any part thereof other than that part so decided to be unconstitutional or invalid.

ARTICLE II 
Environmental Review Procedures 
§ 128-2-10. Lead agency. 
A. The lead agency shall be that local agency principally responsible for carrying out, funding or approving an action. The lead agency is responsible for determining whether an EIS is required for an action, and for preparation and filing of any such EIS. 
B. Where more than one agency is involved, the lead agency shall be determined and designated as provided in Section 6 of Part 617. [Amended 2-9-1999 by L.L. No. 3-1999] 
C. The Planning Department will be the Town clearinghouse for lead agency designations. It will assist agencies and applicants in identifying other federal, state and local agencies that will be involved in approving, funding or carrying out an action. The clearinghouse will make recommendations on designation lead agencies for particular actions. 
D. Environmental review of actions involving a federal agency will be processed in accordance with Section 15 of Part 617. [Amended 2-9-1999 by L.L. No. 3-1999] 
§ 128-2-20. Environmental assessment and determination of significance. 
A. When any local agency of the Town of East Hampton contemplates directly carrying out, funding or approving a Type I Action, a full EAF must be prepared on its behalf. When an unlisted action is contemplated, either a full or short form EAF, as appropriate, must be prepared. The EAF forms given in Appendices A, B and C of Part 617 will be used as models by the Town, but the Planning Department may, from time to time, modify such models in designing its own EAF forms, or to meet the needs of a particular case. In each instance, however, the final scope of such modified EAF must be at least as comprehensive as the scope of the model forms. [Amended 2-9-1999 by L.L. No. 3-1999] 
B. When any person submits an application for funding or a permit or other approval of a Type I or unlisted action to any local agency, an EAF Part One must accompany the application. For Type I Actions a full EAF must then be prepared; for unlisted actions either the full EAF or the Short-Form EAF may be used as appropriate. An applicant may choose to prepare a DEIS in lieu of any EAF. 
C. The lead agency must make a determination of the environmental significance of the action. This determination must be based upon the EAF, or, with respect to unlisted actions, its own procedures, as the case may be, as well as on any other relevant information it may require. The criteria stated in Section 7 of Part 617 must also be considered by the lead agency in making the required determination of significance. The determination must be made within 20 days of its designation as lead agency, or within 20 days of its receipt of all information it requires, whichever is later. [Amended 2-9-1999 by L.L. No. 3-1999] 
D. For I actions, the lead agency must give public notice and file any determination of nonsignificance as provided in Part 617. For unlisted actions, the lead agency must send any determination of nonsignificance to the applicant, if any, and maintain its own records thereof in accordance with the provisions of Part 617. [Amended 8-7-1987 by L.L. No. 10-1987] 
E. If the lead agency makes a determination of nonsignificance, the direct action, approval or 
§ 128-2-20 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 128-2-40 
funding involved in the action, as well as the decisions involved with the same, may be processed without further regard to SEQRA, Part 617 or this chapter. 
F. For the purposes of determining compliance with any law or regulation governing the maximum allowable period of review permitted for any local agency, the time of filing an application for approval or funding of an action shall be deemed to have been the date on which the determination of environmental nonsignificance is made. If a finding of significance is made and an EIS is required, or if the applicant has prepared a DEIS in lieu of any EAF, the time of filing shall be the date the lead agency formally accepts the DEIS as adequate in scope and content and otherwise sufficient and commences the public comment period thereon. 
§ 128-2-30. EIS preparation. 
A. If, based upon review of the EAF and other information, the lead agency determines that the proposed action may be environmentally significant, then an EIS must be prepared. 
B. If an EIS is required, the lead agency must proceed as provided in Sections 9, 11 and 12 of Part 617. Where there is an applicant involved, the DEIS will normally be prepared by the applicant, and failure of an applicant to prepare a DEIS shall relieve the lead agency of any further responsibility to review the application. If the applicant prepares a DEIS which is unacceptable to the lead agency, the lead agency may either prepare a DEIS itself, discontinue further processing until the applicant can provide an acceptable DEIS or deem the application abandoned and discontinue review. [Amended 2-9-1999 by L.L. No. 3-1999] 
C. If a public hearing is held on the DEIS, it must, whenever possible, be concurrent with any other hearing on the application.91 
§ 128-2-40. Additional requirements for certain East Hampton Airport actions. [Added 2-9-1999 by L.L. No. 3-1999] 
A. Section 128-3-20.B(9) and (10) list certain airport actions that shall be Type I actions in the Town of East Hampton. 
B. Prior to filing any determination of nonenvironmental significance as provided in Part 617 regarding the certain airport actions listed in § 128-3-20B(9) and (10), the Town Board as lead agency shall hold a public hearing and receive public comment on the environmental significance of the action. 
C. If the Town Board as lead agency determines that a proposed action listed in § 128-3-20B(9) or (10) may be environmentally significant and that an EIS must be prepared, the lead agency shall, in addition to the requirements set forth in § 128-2-30 above, require the DEIS to include: 
(1) 
A cost/benefit analysis of the proposed action; and 

(2) 
A study of actual and projected noise impacts using methodology that takes into account single-event noise and seasonal and weekend concentration of noise impacts.

Fees and Costs [Added 5-1-1992 by L.L. No. 7-1992] 
§ 128-4-10. General provisions. 
An applicant seeking the approval of one or more local agencies in order to undertake an action shall, if a DEIS is prepared for the action, remit to the local agency acting as lead agency a DEIS preparation or review fee determined as set forth herein. 
A. Recoverable costs. The fee charged for preparation or review of a DEIS shall not exceed the actual costs of the lead agency in preparing or reviewing the DEIS, and shall be limited to the following: 
(1) 
The cost of assisting in the preparation or review of the DEIS by the Planning Department and Natural Resources Department, as calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by each employee of each such department, exclusive of secretarial staff, by the estimated hourly wage or salary of the respective employee; 

(2) 
The cost of preparation or review by the Town Engineer or said Engineer's subordinate, as billed to the lead agency, or, if the Town Engineer is an employee of the Town, as calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by the Engineer or his or her subordinate by the estimated hourly wage or salary of the Engineer or his or her subordinate; 

(3) 
The cost of personal or professional services rendered and billed to the lead agency by persons or individuals retained to assist in preparing or reviewing the DEIS, such as, by way of example and not by way of limitation, printers, stenographers and specialists in disciplines for which the Planning Department or Natural Resources Department lack the necessary expertise (e.g., archaeology); 

(4) 
The cost of such goods or services as paper, supplies, postage, telephone or facsimile transmission line time, publication charges and the like, whose use or expenditure is directly attributable to the preparation or review of the DEIS; and 

(5) 
Photocopying costs, at a rate which may be established by the lead agency to reflect its estimated actual cost per photocopied page. 


B. Scope of recoverable costs. For the purpose of calculating the costs recoverable under the preceding subsection, the preparation or review of a DEIS shall include the following: 
(1) 
The actual preparation of the DEIS, if done by the lead agency, or the scoping and critique of a DEIS prepared by an applicant; and 

(2) 
The preparation of a final EIS by the lead agency, and the preparation and dissemination of all required public notices and copies of the DEIS and final EIS. 


C. Limitations on fee. Notwithstanding any computation of costs made under the preceding subsections, no fee shall be charged an applicant for the review of a DEIS which exceeds the following amounts: 
(1) For residential or commercial subdivisions of land or projects involving residential or multiple residential construction, 1% of the fair market value of the land which is the 
§ 128-4-10 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 128-4-10 
subject of the application plus, for subdivisions and multiple residential construction projects only, the cost of site clearing and regrading, road and parking improvements and installation of drainage, all as estimated by the Town Engineer; 
(2) 
For projects involving commercial or nonresidential construction, 1/2 of 1% of the total cost of project construction, including the cost of construction materials, labor, site clearing and regrading, road and parking improvements and utility and drainage installation, as estimated by the Town Engineer with reference, if practicable, to current cost data publications in common usage; 

(3) 
For projects involving the extraction of minerals, including sand and gravel mining but not dredging, 1/2 of 1% of the total cost of site preparation, including the cost of clearing and grubbing, removal of overburden, access road and parking improvements and utility and drainage installation, as estimated by the Town Engineer, with project costs to be incurred three or more years after project approval to be calculated on the basis of present value; or 

(4) 
For dredging projects, 1/2 of 1% of the total project cost, including the cost of the dredging itself, plus site preparation, construction of dikes or retaining structures, spoil drainage structures, removal or redeposition of dredge spoil, and the like, as estimated by the Town Engineer, which project costs to be incurred three or more years after project approval to be calculated on the basis of present value. 


D. Cumulative limitations on fee. Where an action for which a DEIS is prepared involves more than one of the activities enumerated in the preceding subsection, the limitation on the review fee which may be charged to the applicant shall be determined by computing a separate maximum fee for each discrete activity and adding them together. 
E. Notice of fee payable. The lead agency shall provide an applicant with written notice of the amount of the fee payable to the agency under this article for preparation or review of a DEIS, with notice to be given in the following manner: 
(1) 
The said notice shall be given either no later than the date on which the final EIS on the action is filed or, if a final EIS is not prepared, no later than 10 days from either the close of the public hearing on the DEIS or from the filing of the notice of completion of the DEIS (if no hearing is held). 

(2) 
Failure to give timely notice of the amount of the fee payable shall not affect the lead agency's right to collect the fee, but it shall stop the agency from withholding its decision on the application until the fee has been paid in accordance with the following subsection. 


F. Payment of fee before issuance of agency's determination; relationship to Town Law. Any fee required of an applicant under this article shall be remitted in full to the lead agency before the issuance of the lead agency's final determination on the application, and the time deadline for agency decisionmaking contained in 6 NYCRR § 617.11 shall be tolled accordingly. Should this provision be deemed in any way inconsistent with the time deadline for the Zoning Board of Appeals to decide an appeal or other matter before it, contained in § 267 (effective until July 1, 1992) or § 267-a (effective July 1, 1992) of the New York Town Law, or with the time deadlines for the Planning Board to decide on an application for site plan approval or issuance of a special permit, contained in § 274-a of the New York Town Law, or with the time deadlines for the Planning Board to conditionally or unconditionally approve or disapprove applications for preliminary or final subdivision approval, contained in § 276 of the New York Town Law, the aforesaid time deadlines contained in Town Law §§ 267 (effective until July 1, 1992), 267-a (effective July 1, 1992), 274a and 276 are hereby superseded to the extent that they could be construed to require local agency action before the remittance of the fees required herein. 
[Amended 2-9-1999 by L.L. No. 3-1999] 
G. Additional charges. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Subsection E or F above, where the lead agency's cost of preparing or reviewing a DEIS includes costs or charges which are not billed to the lead agency until after expiration of the agency's time for giving written notice to the applicant of the fee payable, the lead agency may nonetheless charge these additional costs to the applicant, either by conditioning its approval of the action on payment of these charges or by otherwise charging the applicant. 
H. Supplemental EIS; uncompleted DEIS. Where proper consideration of a proposed action necessitates the preparation of a supplemental EIS (SEIS), the imposition of a fee for the lead agency's preparation or review of the SEIS shall be governed by the provisions of this article governing the computation and collection of the fee for preparation or review of the DEIS. If a DEIS being prepared for an action is not completed, for whatever reason, the lead agency preparing or reviewing the same shall nevertheless be entitled to compute and collect a fee for its preparation or review of the uncompleted DEIS. Where necessary to the computation and collection of fees in the foregoing circumstances, the provisions of this article shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate their general purpose of allowing the lead agency an equitable reimbursement for its cost of preparing or reviewing an EIS. 
I. Waiver of fee for not-for-profit or public applicant. Where the applicant in an action for which a DEIS is prepared is a not-for-profit corporation, another municipality, a school district or similar governmental or quasi-public body, the lead agency may, with the consent of the Town Board, waive the payment of all or any part of the DEIS preparation or review fee required by this article. 
§ 128-4-20. Determination of fee for lead agency's preparation of DEIS. 
A. Fee to reflect actual costs. Where an applicant proposes an action which will require the preparation of a DEIS, but the applicant requests that the lead agency prepare the DEIS, the fee charged the applicant shall reflect the lead agency's actual cost of preparing the DEIS as calculated pursuant to § 128-4-10A and B, but without regard to the limitations on fees set forth in § 128-4-10C and D. 
B. Estimated fee. The lead agency shall, upon request, provide an applicant with a written estimate of the fee which it would charge for preparation of the DEIS on that applicants project. If the lead agency does undertake to prepare a DEIS at the applicant's request, it shall not be bound by such estimated fee, but the agency shall seek to minimize the cost of preparation of the DEIS to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with its need to properly evaluate the environmental impacts of the proposed action. However, in any case where the lead agency has provided the applicant with a written estimate of its cost to prepare a DEIS, the agency shall not charge a fee for its preparation of the DEIS which is more than 150% of the written estimate. 
§ 128-4-30. Appeal of fee. 
§ 128-4-30 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 128-4-30 
A. Appeal to Town Board. If an applicant contends that a fee charged by a local agency (including the Town Board) under this article for preparation or review of a DEIS exceeds the agency's actual cost of preparing or reviewing the DEIS, or that the fee was improperly determined under the procedures and criteria set forth in this chapter, or that it is in some other way inequitable, the applicant shall make written appeal to the Town Board, setting forth the grounds for the appeal and the amount of the fee which the applicant believes should have properly been charged. 
B. Processing of appeal. Upon receipt of an appeal brought under the preceding subsection, the Town Board or its designee shall examine the records of the lead agency upon which the fee was computed for the purpose of deciding if the fee was properly and equitably determined. Thereafter, and within two weeks of its receipt of the written appeal, the Town Board or its designee shall make written response to the applicant setting forth the reasons why the fee was properly determined or, if that is not the case, stating why the fee was improperly determined and the correct amount of the fee. 
C. Town Board's failure to answer appeal within two weeks. Failure of the Town Board or its designee to make written reply to an applicant within two weeks of receipt of a properly presented appeal shall not affect the lead agency's right to collect the contested fee, in such amount as the Town Board may ultimately determine to be correct. However, such failure to make a timely written reply shall stop the lead agency from withholding its decision on the application (in accordance with § 128-4-10F) until the contested fee has been paid, but if and only if the applicant notifies the lead agency in writing of the Town Board's failure to timely respond to the applicant's appeal.

Right To Farm [Adopted 5-7-1982 by L.L. No. 2-1982] 
§ 134-1. Legislative findings. 
A. It is the declared policy of the Town of East Hampton to conserve, protect and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land. The amendment to the Town Comprehensive Plan adopted March 3, 1982, outlines the importance of agriculture to the town, the danger to the farmers and farming resulting from continued development and means of protecting agriculture and preserving farmland. 
B. Among the benefits of agriculture are an available food supply, economic prosperity, preservation of environmental quality and the maintenance of our unique rural character. 
C. The continued extension of nonagricultural land uses into prime agricultural areas often results in agricultural activities being the subject of legal actions. As a result, agricultural activities are often forced to cease, while others are discouraged from undertaking agricultural improvements. 
D. The Town Comprehensive Plan cites the enactment of a right to farm law as a means of protecting and encouraging agricultural activities. It is the purpose of this law to implement this portion of the Town Comprehensive Plan.

ARTICLE II 
Farmland Preservation [Adopted 8-6-1982 by L.L. No. 6-1982] 
§ 134-7. Findings. 
A. The Town Board of the Town of East Hampton hereby finds that agriculture is one of the keystones to the economy of the town. Further, it contributes to the rural ambience of the town and is an essential part of the unique character which makes East Hampton aesthetically attractive. The Board further finds that agriculture is threatened by intense developmental pressures which affect all open space in the town. Since 1965 the town has seen its agricultural land decrease from over 2,900 acres to approximately 1,577 acres. 
B. An amendment to the Town Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 1982 with the goal of preserving at least 1,200 acres of the existing agricultural land. Among the tools needed to accomplish this goal is the purchase of development rights to agricultural lands pursuant to § 247 of the General Municipal Law. In 1981 the voters of the Town of East Hampton approved a bond issue of $1,500,000 to provide funds for such a program. 
C. To implement this program, the Board wishes to adopt this article to the Town Code. The Board also recognizes that in the future additional bond issues may also be approved and that a permanent mechanism is necessary to provide for such purchases in the future. 
D. The Board also finds that funds for development right purchases can most effectively be utilized only where other available farmland preservation tools are ineffective. Thus, the Board does not wish to utilize these funds to generally solicit offers, but rather to first assess the use of other preservation tools and only utilize these funds to purchase development rights when these other tools cannot avert the loss of prime agricultural land. 
§ 134-8. Definitions. 
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
CONSTRUCTION PERMIT  Authorization to erect structures after public hearing of the Town Board. 
DEVELOPMENT RIGHT  The permanent legal interest and right to prohibit or restrict the use of the premises for anything other than agricultural production as that term is presently defined in the New York State Agriculture and Markets Law § 301. 
WAIVER LETTER  Authorization by the Planning Board Chairman to erect structures where no construction permit is required. 
§ 134-9. Acquisition of development rights. 
A. A recommendation for the purpose of development rights may be initiated by any of the following: 
(1) 
The Town Board, upon its own motion. 

(2) 
Planning Board recommendation to the Town Board. 

(3) 
Owner of agricultural lands, by request to the Town Board. 

B. 
Where, pursuant to Subsection A(1) or (2), the recommendation for the purchase of development is initiated by the Town Board or the Planning Board, the Town Board shall first contact the owner of the agricultural lands to solicit participation under this article. Where the owner wishes to participate under this article, he shall so request in writing. Where the recommendation is initiated by the owner pursuant to Subsection A(3) of this section, such request shall be in writing. 

C. 
Upon the receipt of a written request from the owner, the Town Board shall cause to be prepared a real estate appraisal to ascertain the market value of the development rights to be acquired. 

D. 
The Town Board, on the basis of the appraisal, may negotiate with the owner of agricultural lands in order to enter into a contract of sale. Such contract shall be in writing and shall be signed by the Supervisor on behalf of the town, upon authorization by a resolution of the Town Board. Such contract shall be conditional and shall not be final until after the holding of a public hearing and passage of a resolution of the Town Board pursuant to Subsections E and F of this section. 

E. 
Upon the signing of a contract of sale, the Town Board shall conduct a public hearing on such contract. 

F. 
Within 30 days after the public hearing, the Town Board by resolution shall accept or reject the contract. 

G. 
The instrument of conveyance transferring the development rights to the town shall be executed by the Supervisor on behalf of the town, as well as the grantor, and shall contain a covenant specifically setting forth the methods of alienation of the development rights and the limitations on use and enjoyment of the estate or interest reserved by the grantor as same are set forth as of the date of the contract of sale of said development rights. 

H. 
Development rights may be alienated only in the manner provided for the modification or termination of easements set forth in Chapter 16 of this Code; provided, however, that where ownership of such rights is to be transferred to another governmental entity, the requirements of Chapter 16 shall not be applicable if and only if: [Amended 5-18-1984 by L.L. No. 13-1984] 

(1) 
The government entity is the County of Suffolk, State of New York, or the United States of America, or any combination of the above; 

(2) 
The rights to be transferred are to be "banked" or otherwise retired under the provisions of a farmland preservation program undertaken by the transferee; and 

(3) 
All moneys received by the town in consideration for the rights so transferred, less reasonable costs or expenses, if any, are to be placed into the account maintained by the Town for the purchase of development rights or for other expenditures directly connected with farmland preservation under this article.

Further, in the case of properties whose development rights have been conveyed by the town to the County of Suffolk, no such approval shall be given by the Planning Board unless and until the proposed division shall have been formally approved by vote of the Suffolk County Farmland Committee, established by county local law in 1981, or its legal successor. [Added 3-6-1987 by L.L. No. 4-1987] 
§ 134-10. Erection of structures subsequent to transfer of development rights. 
No structure, including paved walkways, driveways and roadways, of any kind shall be permitted to be erected or maintained, except for a structure legally existing on the date of transfer, subsequent to the transfer of development rights to the town, except as specifically set forth in Subsections A and B following:

§ 150-50. Review of actions. 
A.

No action in the coastal area shall be approved, funded or undertaken by an agency without such a determination. 
B. The Town Planning Department shall be responsible for coordinating review of actions in the Town's coastal area for consistency with the LWRP and will advise, assist and make consistency recommendations for other Town agencies in the implementation of the LWRP, its policies and projects, including physical, legislative, regulatory, administrative and other actions included in the program. The Planning Department will also coordinate with NYSDOS regarding consistency review for actions by state or federal agencies. 
C. The Planning Department will assist each agency with preliminary evaluation of actions in the coastal area and with preparation of a coastal assessment form (CAF). Whenever an agency receives an application for approval or funding of an action, or as early as possible in the agency's formulation of a direct action to be located in the coastal area, the agency shall refer to the Planning Department for preparation of a CAF, a sample of which is appended to this local law.94 The Planning Department staff will coordinate their preliminary evaluation with permitting or other review by each agency or the agencies considering an action. 
D. The Planning Department shall require the applicant to submit all completed applications, EAFs, and any other information deemed necessary to its consistency recommendation.

The Planning Department shall, along with its consistency recommendation, make any suggestions to the agency concerning modification of the proposed action, including the imposition of conditions, to make it consistent with LWRP policy standards and objectives or to greater advance them. 
E. If an action requires approval of more than one agency, decision-making will be coordinated between agencies to determine which agency will conduct the final consistency review, and that agency will thereafter act as designated consistency review agency. Only one CAF per action will be prepared. If the agencies cannot agree, the Planning Director shall designate the consistency review agency. 
F. Upon recommendation of the Planning Department, the agency shall consider whether the proposed action is consistent with the LWRP policy standards summarized in Subsection I herein. Prior to making its determination of consistency, the agency shall consider the consistency recommendation of the Planning Department. The agency shall render a written determination of consistency based on the CAF, the Planning Department recommendation and such other information as is deemed necessary to its determination. No approval or decision shall be rendered for an action in the coastal area without a determination of consistency. The designated agency will make the final determination of consistency. 
G. Where an EIS is being prepared or required, the draft EIS must identify applicable LWRP policies and standards and include a discussion of the effects of the proposed action on such policy standards. No agency may make a final decision on an action that has been the subject of a final EIS and is located in the coastal area until the agency has made a written finding regarding the consistency of the action with the local policy standards referred to in Subsection I herein.

This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Town of East Hampton Nature Preserve." 
§ 182-2. Purpose and public policy. 
A. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a Town Nature Preserve so that certain Town-owned properties can be protected. 
B. Due to the growth of the population and the development of the economy in the Town, all Town-owned properties, except those that are expressly designated by law for preservation and protection in their natural condition, are subject to alteration by human activity. It is necessary and desirable that portions of the Town's natural diversity be set aside as natural areas for the benefit of present and future generations in order to achieve the following objectives: 
(1) 
Heritage: to protect natural areas which provide living museums of the original heritage of the Town and contribute to the public health and welfare of the inhabitants. Rural ambiance and environmental quality have traditionally contributed to the Town's economic base and continue to provide economic opportunity to the residents of the Town. 

(2) 
Environmental quality: to protect the existing and, where desirable, to promote an improved environmental quality of natural areas in the Town, including but not limited to critical environmental areas, significant coastal fish and wildlife habitats and unique site types. 

(3) 
Habitat for aquatic and upland ecological communities: to preserve ecosystems and the rich diversity of flora and fauna living thereon, including rare, threatened, endangered and protected species. 

(4) 
Unique geological features: to protect the diversity of unique geological features found within the Town, including beaches, dunes, bluffs, hoodoos, swales, kettleholes, kames, morainal highlands and outwash plains. 

(5) 
Wetlands: to protect wetlands as a means of flood control, water purification and breeding and nursery grounds for shellfish, fin fish and other aquatic flora and fauna. 

(6) 
Recreational, educational and scientific opportunities: to provide opportunities for wilderness-like experiences, diverse recreational activities and environmental educational programs and academic research programs. 

(7) 
Buffer areas: to provide buffer areas to existing natural areas. 

(8) 
Watershed areas: to protect watershed areas critical to recharging precipitation into the Town's sole-source aquifer or maintaining surface water quality. 


C. It is, therefore, the public policy of the Town to secure for the people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of natural areas by establishing a Town Nature Preserve and to provide for the protection of the Town-owned properties placed 
§ 182-2 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 182-4

Along with this existing threat, Long Islanders absorbed large electric rates so that Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant would be shut down, resulting in further opposition to nuclear activities. Because of this consensus of opposition, the town seeks to adopt a law that declares the town to be a Nuclear Free Zone, as set forth herein.

This chapter of the East Hampton Town Code shall be known and may be cited as the "Town of East Hampton Open Space Preservation Law." 
§ 193-1-15. Purposes. 
This chapter is adopted for the purposes of promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the Town of East Hampton by encouraging the preservation of natural and open lands in order to achieve the following objectives: 
A. Preservation of scenic and aesthetic qualities of land, to preserve the visual amenities of open lands in the Town of East Hampton, in order to protect the rural character and scenic beauty which is the cornerstone of the town's resort economy and the essence of East Hampton's sense of place. 
B. Conservation of natural resources and wildlife habitat, to conserve the town's important natural features, resources and systems in order to protect flora and fauna and the habitat which they need to survive, to support the natural regime on which the town's agricultural and fishing industries depend and to conserve the unique quality of life which East Hampton's citizens enjoy. 
C. Preservation of agricultural lands, to preserve the prime agricultural soils which are the underpinning of the town's farm economy and which contribute significantly to the town's rural and historic character. 
D. Protection of groundwater supplies, to protect the sole source groundwater aquifer upon which all of the town's residents and visitors rely for their drinking water. 
E. Protection of wetlands and of the purity of tidal and fresh waters, to protect the purity and ecological integrity of the town's abundant tidal and fresh waters, the fish and shellfish which live in these waters and the wetlands which protect and nurture them. 
F. Economical provision of highways, utilities and other public infrastructure, to reduce the costs of constructing and maintaining subdivision roads and associated public and quasi-public improvements by ensuring that such infrastructure is provided in a compact and economical fashion. 
G. Protection of cultural and historic resources, to protect cultural and historic sites, including historically significant vistas, archaeological remains and similar features which are an important part of the town's heritage. 
H. Provision of recreational opportunities, to encourage the recreational use of open lands where such use will complement the town's resort economy, foster an appreciation of the town's natural and cultural heritage and contribute to the quality of life from which all the town's residents and visitors can benefit. 
I. Promotion of flexibility in planning, to encourage flexibility in the design and development of land in order to promote the most appropriate use of land in furtherance of these objectives.

OPEN SPACE  Lands shown on a subdivision map or plat which are set aside by the Planning Board for preservation or conservation, in order to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. This term shall not be deemed to include lands which are or will be used for a purpose prohibited by Article IV hereof, nor shall it be deemed to include either of the following: 
A. Land which is within the boundaries of a house lot or other building lot shown on the subdivision plat; or 
B. Land which is within the right-of-way of a street, road or highway shown on the subdivision plat. 
OPEN SPACE SUBDIVISION  A subdivision approved pursuant to Article II of this chapter. 
PRIME AGRICULTURAL SOILS  Soils belonging to Capability Class I or II, as described in the 1975 Soil Survey of Suffolk County, New York, prepared by the Soil Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. 
§ 193-1-45. Determination of yield. 
In exercising the powers granted in this chapter, the Planning Board shall not approve, nor shall it be authorized to approve, the creation on one or more tracts or parcels of land of a number of lots and/or dwelling units which exceeds the total number of lots into which these lands could be divided by standard subdivision approved pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 220, Subdivision of Land, of this Code. In approving any application for the division or development of land hereunder, the Board shall require the applicant to prepare and submit a standard subdivision plat for each parcel of land involved in the application, which conforms to the minimum lot size and density requirements of Chapter 255 of this Code and to all pertinent requirements of Chapter 220, Subdivision of Land. 
§ 193-1-60. Multiple residence developments. 
In exercising the powers granted in this chapter, the Planning Board shall have authority to permit or to require that some or all of the dwelling units to which particular lands are entitled, under the procedures for determining yield set forth herein, be in the form of apartments or multiple residences. Whether requested by the applicant or required by the Planning Board, any such multiple residence development shall be subject to the following procedures and standards: 
A. Requirement of site plan approval. In reviewing and approving a multiple residence development as defined herein, pursuant to the authority granted in this chapter, the Planning Board shall have all of the powers and duties conferred upon it in Article VI, Site Plan Review, of Chapter 255, Zoning, of this Code, and such multiple residence development shall be subject to site plan review and approval as provided therein. Where a multiple residence development is proposed as part of an open space subdivision, the Planning Board shall hold its public hearing on the multiple residence development concurrently with its public hearing on the preliminary subdivision application. 
B. Submission of site plan application. Where approval of a multiple residence development is requested by an applicant or the submission of a plan for such development is required by the Planning Board, the applicant shall submit an application for site plan approval of the same, meeting all requirements of Article VI of Chapter 255 of this Code. 
C. Requirement of Town Board approval; Town Law superseded. Any such multiple residence development shall require approval by the Town Board as a special permit use after issuance of conditional site plan approval by the Planning Board. To the extent that the reservation of powers in the Town Board which are set forth in this subsection might be construed to conflict with provisions of the New York Town Law relating to special permits, cluster development or the relative powers of Town boards and planning boards, including but not limited to provisions of §§ 271, 274-a and 278 of the Town Law, those provisions of the Town Law are hereby superseded. In considering an application for approval of a multiple residence development hereunder, the Town Board shall adhere to the following procedures and standards: 
(1) 
The Town Board shall hold a public hearing on the application on at least 10 days' notice, such notice to be given by the Town Board and the applicant in the manner provided in § 255-9-23 of this Code. 

(2) 
In deciding whether or not to issue a special permit for a multiple residence development pursuant to this section, the Town Board shall have plenary power to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application. The Town Board shall not, however, have power to increase the permissible yield for the application, as determined by the Planning Board, to reduce the yard setbacks required of a multiple residence development by § 255-11-10 of this Code or to alter the boundaries of the lot or parcel containing the multiple residence development. 

(3) 
The Town Board may by resolution approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the 


§ 193-1-60 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 193-1-80 
subject application no later than 62 days after the close of the public hearing held thereon, unless this time period has been extended with the consent of the applicant. However, in the event the Town Board fails to so act within the requisite time period, the application shall be deemed to have been disapproved by the Town Board. 
§ 193-1-75. Overcrowding of dwelling units prohibited. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in exercising the powers conferred upon it by this chapter the Planning Board shall comply at all times with the provisions of § 255-1-70 of this Code regarding maximum permissible density per acre of land. 
§ 193-1-80. Effect of recodification. 
Where any earlier provision of this chapter has been retained, continued or reenacted herein, whether or not in modified form, but is located in a renumbered section or paragraph hereof, all references contained in other chapters of this Code to such earlier provision shall be deemed amended so as to refer to the renumbered section or paragraph hereof in which the provision is now contained.

§ 193-2-10. Power to modify Zoning Code. [Amended 8-6-2004 by L.L. No. 22-2004] 
The Planning Board of the Town of East Hampton shall have authority to modify the dimensional requirements and restrictions of Chapter 255, Zoning, of the Town Code in approving the subdivision of land, so as to achieve the purposes and objectives set forth in Article I of this chapter. This grant of authority shall include the power to modify the provisions of the Chapter 255 with respect to: the minimum area or width of lots or parcels of land; the minimum setbacks of buildings or structures from any street; property line, natural feature or from any other structure; the maximum coverage or total coverage permitted on any lot or parcel of land; the maximum clearing permitted on any single lot or parcel of land pursuant to § 255-2-60 of this Code provided that the restrictions set forth in § 255-2-60 for each individual lot are met within the subdivision taken as a whole; the maximum number of dwellings (including apartments) which may be constructed on a lot or parcel, but it shall not include the power to reduce the minimum setback required from a natural feature by any provision of Chapter 255 or the power to reduce the yard setbacks required of a multiple residence development by § 255-11-10 of this Code.

The Planning Board may exercise the powers conferred upon it in this article in approving the subdivision of land within all residential zoning districts in the Town of East Hampton, except the B Residence Zoning District. 
§ 193-2-30. Treatment of contiguous lands. 
In exercising the powers conferred upon it in this article, the Planning Board may treat two or more contiguous parcels of land in the same record ownership as a single tract or parcel, notwithstanding that they are separated by a public or private street, highway or right-of-way not so owned. Where such parcels lie in more than one residential zoning district, these different zoning classifications shall not restrict the Planning Board's ability to locate lots as the Board finds will best suit the purposes set forth in Article I hereof, but the Board shall give due consideration in these cases to differences in community character or in natural or man-made features, resources or systems which the respective zoning classifications were intended to foster or protect. 
§ 193-2-40. Procedure. 
In approving the subdivision of land, the Planning Board may modify the dimensional requirements and restrictions of Chapter 255 of this Code, to the extent permitted by § 193-2-10 hereof, in the following circumstances: 
A. Application by land owner. Upon receipt of a written application for the same by an owner of land, the Planning Board may exercise the powers conferred upon it in this article when the Board, in its discretion, finds that the use of this power would benefit the Town and would advance one or more of the objectives enumerated in § 220-2.03 of this Code. 
B. Consent of land owner not required. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Planning Board may exercise the powers granted in this article without regard to whether 
§ 193-2-40 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 193-2-60 
an applicant for subdivision of land has made written application therefor if, in the discretion of the Board, it finds that the use of this power would benefit the Town and would advance one or more of the objectives enumerated in § 220-2.03 of this Code. 
§ 193-2-50. Mandatory use of procedure. [Amended 7-6-2007 by L.L. No. 25-2007] 
Except as set forth in § 193-2-80 hereof, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, the following described lands shall not be subdivided except as open space subdivisions pursuant to this chapter and in which the minimum open space requirements set forth in § 193-2-60 below are satisfied: 
A. Agricultural Overlay District. Lands located either wholly or partly within the Agricultural Overlay District. 
B. Water Recharge Overlay District. Lands located either wholly or partly within the Water Recharge Overlay District. 
C. Prime agricultural soils. Lands containing prime agricultural soils whose preservation would implement the Town's Comprehensive Plan. 
D. Residence Districts A3, A5, and A10. Lands located either wholly or partly within the Residence Districts A3, A5, and A10. 
§ 193-2-60. Open space requirements. [Amended 7-6-2007 by L.L. No. 25-2007] 
The Planning Board's exercise of its powers pursuant to this chapter shall result in the preservation as open space in the subdivision map or plat of the following percentages of the total acreage of land which is proposed for subdivision subject to any limitations set forth in § 193-2-62 below: 
A. Open space subdivisions containing prime agricultural soils or located wholly or partly within the Agricultural Overlay District. Where a subdivision of land contains prime agricultural soils or is wholly or partly within the Agricultural Overlay District, 70% of the total acreage of land containing prime agricultural soils shall be set aside as agricultural open space. 
B. Open space subdivisions of properties located wholly or partly within the A10 or A5 Residence Zoning Districts. 
(1) 
Fifty percent of the property shall be preserved as open space. 

(2)

§ 193-2-62. Reduction of open space requirements. [Added 7-6-2007 by L.L. No. 25-2007] 
Notwithstanding the mandatory open space subdivision requirements set forth in § 193-2-60 hereof, the Planning Board may allow the division of a tract or parcel which is subject to the provisions of § 193-2-60 to reduce the amount of required open space to 50% where 60% or 70% is required and to 35% where 50% is required under the following circumstances: 
A. Where the character of the neighborhood is such that at least three sides of the proposed subdivision contain small lots created by old filed maps or the Urban Renewal Plan; or 
B. Where the location of pre-existing historic or architectural features, structures or settings identified by the Town' s historic preservation consultant limit the layout of a subdivision so that a design with less than the required percentage of open space will result in greater protection of the property's significant historic or architectural features, structures or settings. 
§ 193-2-65. Allowable clearing within Open Space Subdivisions. [Added 7-6-2007 by L.L. No. 25-2007]

Zoning District Size of Reserved Area Permitted Clearing 
A3 Residence 50% to 59% of the 55% of lot area property 
A3 Residence 60% or more of the 75% of lot area property 
§ 193-2-65 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 193-2-70

A10 Residence 70% or more of the 70% of lot area property 
A10 and Water Recharge Overlay 70% or more of the 50% of lot area District and/or Harbor Protection Overlay property District 
A. In calculating the amount of clearing permitted by this section on a flag lot or a lot which is burdened by a common driveway easement or access easement, the area of any flag strip or any common driveway easement or access easement shall be excluded from the lot area. Likewise, any clearing for driveway purposes within the flag strip or within the common driveway easement or access easement shall not be counted as part of the permissible amount of clearing. 
B. If the open space requirements have been reduced pursuant to § 193-2-62, clearing on the lots shall be governed by §§ 255-2-60 and 193-2-10. 
§ 193-2-70. Development of agricultural lands.97 
Because of the crucial importance of prime agricultural lands to the continued vitality of the town's farming industries, as well as in defining East Hampton's visual character and sense of place, special care must be taken to ensure that the provisions of this chapter which affect agricultural land are strictly and carefully implemented. For this purpose, the following rules shall apply in the subdivision of land containing prime agricultural soils: 
A. Calculation of prime agricultural soils. The Planning Board shall calculate the minimum acreage of prime agricultural soils which must be set aside as open space pursuant to § 193-2-60 hereof without deducting the areas of such soils which are occupied at the time of subdivision by buildings and structures or which are otherwise rendered impracticable for agricultural use by virtue of the location of such buildings or structures. 
B. Maximized preservation of prime soils. Where land which is proposed to be subdivided 
97. Editor's Note: Section II of this local law provided as follows: "The provisions of subparagraph A of § 193-2-70 hereofshall not apply to any subdivision map or plat which has received preliminary subdivision approval from the PlanningBoard on or before the effective date of this local law." 
Downloaded from https://ecode360.com/EA0658 on 2023-11-07 
contains both prime agricultural soils and other soils, the Planning Board may require that development take place on these other soils in order to maximize the preservation of prime agricultural soils. 
§ 193-2-80. Deferment of open space requirements. 
Notwithstanding the mandatory open space subdivision requirement set forth in § 193-2-40 hereof, the Planning Board may in certain circumstances allow the division of a tract or parcel of land which is subject to the provisions of § 193-2-40 into as many as four lots or parcels, without requiring that any or all of the requisite open space is set aside at the time of such subdivision. In any such case, however, creation of the minimum acreage of open space which would otherwise have been required by this article shall be deemed only to have been deferred. To this end, the Planning Board shall not approve a subdivision pursuant to this section except by adhering to the following procedures and safeguards: 
A. Eligibility for subdivision waiver. Any division of land pursuant to this section shall be by subdivision waiver, and the Planning Board shall specifically find and determine that such subdivision is eligible for waiver of subdivision approval in accordance with the criteria set forth in § 220-2.25B(2) or (3) of this Code. 
B. Capability of ultimate compliance with this article. The Board shall ensure that one or more of the lots or parcels created by such subdivision is large enough to accommodate a future open space subdivision in which the minimum open space requirements of this article can be satisfied, as calculated upon the original total acreage of the tract or parcel being subdivided. In so providing, the Board shall require the applicant for subdivision to prepare and submit a map or plat for the future division of the lots or parcels in question, in such detail as the Board may find necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this subsection and with all requirements of Chapter 220 of this Code. 
C. Encumbrances to ensure ultimate compliance. The Board shall require the grant to the Town of a conservation easement, or the preparation and recording of some other suitable instrument encumbering the remaining divisible parcel or parcels, which easement or other instrument provides that, in the event the remaining parcel or parcels are further subdivided, an area of open space will be set aside which is of a character and size sufficient to meet the requirements of this article at the time of the original subdivision, based upon the total acreage of the original tract or parcel.

§ 193-4-50. Restricted ownership of open space. 
In order to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, the restrictions and limitations on ownership which are set forth below shall apply to any open space created hereunder. 
A. Purpose of ownership restrictions. The Planning Board shall impose limitations or restrictions on the ownership of open space created or required by the Board pursuant to this chapter, in order to effectuate the following purposes: 
(1) 
To ensure that open space set aside hereunder continues to serve its intended purpose, e.g., the preservation or conservation of land in perpetuity in its natural or existing condition for nonconsumptive and environmentally sound use. 

(2) 
To ensure that the benefits of the open space may be enjoyed by owners of all lots or dwelling units in the development or by the larger community. 

(3) 
To promote the proper management and care of open space, both to ensure that its scenic and ecological values are protected and to ensure that it does not become derelict or a source of nuisance to the community. 

(4) 
To foster certainty in land titles and avoid the abandonment of land having little economic value by private owners. 

(5) 
To limit the risk that future owners of open space will attempt to convert it to commercial or consumptive uses incompatible with the original purposes for which the land was set aside. 

(6) 
To give public notice of restrictions placed upon the use of open space at time it was set aside. 


B. Limitations on conveyance of fee title. As a condition to approval of a subdivision plat pursuant to this chapter, the Planning Board shall require that fee title to parcels of open space shown on the plat be conveyed to one or more of the following: 
(1) 
A property owners' association incorporated in accordance with the Not-For-Profit Corporation Law of the State of New York and which meets the criteria set forth below. 

(2) 
The Town of East Hampton or other governmental unit or authority, but only to serve one or more of the purposes set forth in this chapter.

A private conservation corporation or land trust approved by the Planning Board, which is required under its charter to own and manage the open space in perpetuity for one or more of the purposes set forth in this chapter and which has the capacity to do so. 


C. Title to agricultural open space. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Planning Board may permit the owner or developer of a subdivision to retain fee title to open space which is set 
§ 193-4-50 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 193-4-50 
aside for agricultural purposes. In any such case, the Planning Board shall ensure that the agricultural open space remains available and suitable for agricultural use in perpetuity by requiring the grant of an agricultural use easement to the Town of East Hampton or to an approved private conservation corporation or land trust, and by imposing such other conditions and restrictions as, in the discretion of the Board, will ensure this result. 
D. Grant of restrictive easements required. Where fee title to open space will be conveyed to a property owners' association, the Planning Board shall ensure that the said open space is used in perpetuity only for the uses approved by the Board and shall ensure that public record notice is given of the nature of restrictions on the open space. To this end, the Planning Board shall: 
(1) 
Require the grant of conservation easements, either to the Town of East Hampton or to an approved private conservation corporation or land trust, and require the filing of such other instruments as will permanently impose the open space restrictions required by this chapter and give record notice of the same. 

(2) 
Impose such other conditions or restrictions as will, in the discretion of the Board, ensure that use of the open space is permanently restricted to those uses approved by the Board. 


E. Conveyance to property owners' association. Title to open space may only be conveyed to a property owners' association if the following requirements are met: 
(1)

§ 215-10. Suspension of access to MS4; illicit discharges in emergency situations. 
A. The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable time thereafter in writing of the reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons. 
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this law may have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor. The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing. Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the SMO. 
§ 215-11. Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
§ 215-12. Access and monitoring of discharges. 
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must inspect to enforce any provision of this law or whenever the authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a violation of this law. 
B. Access to facilities. 
(1) 
The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this law as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this law. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO. 

(2) 
Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records as may be required to implement this law. 

(3) 
The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to this law such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 

(4) 
The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to this law to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this law. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 

(5) 
Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a facility subject to this law is a violation of this law. A person who is the operator of a facility subject to this law commits an offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this law. 

(6) 
If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this law, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this law or any order issued hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 


§ 215-13. Notification of spills. 
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at 
§ 215-13 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 215-16 
least three years. 
§ 215-14. Enforcement. 
A. Notice of violation. When the municipality's SMO finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this law, he/she may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation: 
(1) 
The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 

(2) 
That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 

(3) 
The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 

(4) 
The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 

(5) 
Payment of a fine; and 

(6) 
The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.

A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. 
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the discharger. 
§ 215-17. Injunctive relief. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this law. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this law, the SMO may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation. 
§ 215-18. Alternative remedies. 
A. Where a person has violated a provision of this law, he/she may be eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon recommendation of the Town Attorney and concurrence of the SMO, where:

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 6-5-2014 by L.L. No. 16-2014. Amendments noted where applicable.] 
GENERAL REFERENCES Building construction  See Ch. 102. Storm sewers  See Ch. 215. Environmental quality review  See Ch. 128. Subdivision of land  See Ch. 220. 
§ 216-1.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 216-1.2 
ARTICLE I 
General Provisions 
§ 216-1.1. Findings. 
It is hereby determined that: 
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition. 
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. 
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. 
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation. 
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow. 
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality. 
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities. 
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety. 
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development. 
§ 216-1.2. Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 216-1.1 hereof. This chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives: 
A. Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES general permit for stormwater discharges from municipal separate stormwater sewer systems (MS4s), Permit no. GP-02-02 or as amended or revised; 
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) general permit for construction activities GP-02-01 or as 
amended or revised; 
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels; 
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land development activities which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to the maximum extent practicable; and 
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management practices and to ensure that these management practices are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public safety. 
§ 216-1.3. Statutory authority. 
In accordance with Article 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of New York, the Town of East Hampton has the authority to enact local laws and amend local laws and for the purpose of promoting the health, safety or general welfare of the Town of East Hampton and for the protection and enhancement of its physical environment.

ARTICLE III 
Design Standards 
§ 220-1.07. Open spaces. 
The first consideration in formulation of a design concept shall be the recognition of those areas of significant or critical value identified on the site analysis map and the methods of preservation or conservation, such as but not limited to reserved areas, scenic easements, large lot easements, trail easements, limited access easements and strategic placement of lot lines. 
A. Areas having significant scenic, recreational, historic, archaeological or ecological value shall be first considered for preservation as reserved areas. 
B. Other areas having unusual topographic or natural features shall be considered for protection by means of scenic easements. 
C. Open spaces shall be used to set aside significant areas and for use as buffers to protect environmentally fragile areas. 
D. Insofar as possible, open spaces shall be allocated throughout the subdivision so as to make their benefits available to all lot owners. 
E. Open spaces shall be harmonized with land use patterns in properties adjoining the proposed subdivision, and consideration shall be given to linking the open spaces of adjacent properties or adjacent subdivisions. 
F. Insofar as possible, open spaces in different parts of the proposed subdivision shall be linked by scenic easements. 
G. Consideration shall be given to using open spaces to provide a theme for the proposed subdivision, such as preservation, conservation, passive recreation and active recreation. 
H. Along public roads, residential subdivision plats shall provide reserved area or scenic easement area for at least 10% of the total depth of the subject parcel as a natural buffer from development. The depth of said reserved area or scenic easement shall generally not exceed 100 feet unless other legitimate planning reasons exist for greater reserved area or scenic easement area. 
§ 220-1.08. Building envelope locations. 
After identification and selection of open space areas and prior to the placement of proposed lot lines, building envelopes shall be selected according to the following criteria: 
A. Sufficient elevation above groundwater table to permit proper installation of foundations, septic systems and drainage structures. 
B. Relatively flat terrain, both at the home site and along access drives, requiring a minimum of filling or cutting. 
C. Availability of solar energy. 
D. Shelter from prevailing storm and winter winds for ease of heating. 
§ 220-1.09 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 220-1.10 
§ 220-1.09. Configuration of lot lines. 
After identification and selection of open spaces and building envelopes, proposed lot lines shall be laid out according to the following criteria: 
A. Lot lines should bear a reasonable relationship to topographic features and conditions. 
B. Where slopes, depressions and elevations occur outside open space areas, lot lines shall generally follow such topographic irregularities so as to incorporate such irregularities into required side and rear yards, rather than home sites. 
C. In general, lots shall be rectangular in shape, somewhat deeper than they are wide. 
D. Except in the case of the applications pursuant to Chapter 193, Open Space Preservation, each lot shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 255, Zoning, of the Town Code. 
§ 220-1.10. Roads and common driveways. [Amended 12-3-1999 by L.L. No. 33-1999] 
After identification and selection of open space areas, home sites and proposed lot lines, proposed streets and roads shall be laid out according to the following criteria: 
A. Proposed grades for streets and lot areas shall bear a logical relationship to the natural topography. It is the policy of the Town of East Hampton to discourage massive regrading where such earthmoving would strip natural ground cover or destroy worthwhile topographic features. 
B. All streets and common driveways shall be laid out and constructed in accordance with the Standard Details sheets and specifications contained in Article XIV and XIX of this chapter106 and shall be suitably located, related to the topography, adequately constructed to accommodate the prospective traffic, afford access of emergency equipment, snow removal and other road maintenance equipment and shall be coordinated to compose a convenient system. The Planning Board shall design and lay out roads and common driveways in such a manner as to enhance the rural and aesthetic qualities of the community. 
C. The arrangement of streets shall be such as to cause no undue hardship to adjoining properties and shall, insofar as possible, provide for the continuation of principal streets into adjoining properties. Streets shall conform to the Town Comprehensive Plan. 
D. Direct access from individual lots to existing state, county or collector town roads shall not generally be allowed. 
E. It is the policy of the Planning Board to recommend the acceptance for dedication into the town highway system of all street or road improvements, when they have been completed and maintained in accordance with the specifications con-tained in this chapter.

(c)  The concrete pad to be installed above the cistern tank and below the exposed  
pick-up head shall be set six inches above proposed grade. The number of bollard posts shall be as shown as on the Standard Details.135 The steamer caps  
shall be fastened with chains to the pick-up head.  

C. Special provisions for attached housing and/or multiple dwellings. All subdivisions filing under the provisions of Chapter 193 of this Code and which are to contain attached housing and/or multiple dwellings will be required to provide an adequate water supply for fire­fighting purposes as determined by this subsection. Fir-protection improvements sufficient to meet the water supply requirements, as determined below, shall be constructed. 
(1) 
Preliminary procedures. The applicant shall notify the Town Fire Marshal of his application, in writing, and request that a site survey be undertaken and water supply needs be calculated as described below. The applicant shall provide complete plans and drawings for all proposed structures with all dimensions and distances shown and indicating the intended occupancy and contents as indicated in Subsection C(3) below. The applicant shall notify the Town Fire Marshal, in writing, whenever any plans are made to alter any structure when such alteration would increase the total square footage of any of the structures. Again, complete plans and drawings for such alteration shall be provided as specified above. 

(2) 
Definitions. As used in Subsection C(3) below, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 


OCCUPANCY HAZARD CLASSIFICATION NUMBER  A series of numbers from three to seven that are mathematical factors used only in a formula to determine the total water supply requirements for applications covered under this subsection. These numbers are incorporated from the National Fire Protection Association Publication No. 1231, copyright 1984. For the purposes of this regulation, Occupancy Hazard Classification Number 7 shall be used with structure types defined below. 
OCCUPANCY HAZARD CLASSIFICATION NUMBER 7  Occupancies in this classification are considered light-hazard occupancy, where quantity and combustibility of contents are low. Fires in these occupancies can be expected to develop at a relatively slow rate and have relatively low rates of heat release. Examples of Occupancy Hazard Number 7 include apartments, colleges and universities, dormitories, dwellings, hospitals, hotels and motels, libraries (except large stockroom areas), museums, nursing and convalescent homes, offices (including data processing), prisons and schools. This list of examples shall not be interpreted as. being exclusive, but merely examples of occupancy types falling within this classification. 
STRUCTURE  A building erected for the support, shelter or enclosure of persons, animals or property of any kind. 
(3) Site and structure survey. The Town Fire Marshal shall perform a survey of all structures to be contained on the proposed site in order to compute the total water supply required for fire-fighting needs. The Fire Marshal shall compute the total water supply needed in gallons as per the following: 
(a) Site areas. Where structures are close enough in an area to be served by a single

(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-3.29 
water supply, the water supply shall be computed on the basis of the largest structure in the area. This water supply shall not be less than 3,000 gallons. 
Structures without exposure hazards. For single-and two-family dwellings not greater than 1,200 square feet in total area, including any attached structures, and with no portion of any attached structural exposure hazard closer than 50 feet (unless the attached structure is smaller than 100 square feet), the total water supply shall not be less than 2,000 gallons. For all other structures with no portion of any unattached structural exposure hazard closer than 50 feet (unless the attached structure is smaller than 100 square feet), the total water supply in gallons shall be determined by the total cubic footage of the structure, including any attached structures, divided by the occupancy hazard classification number. For the purposes of this subsection, this number shall be seven as defined above. In any event, the minimum water supply shall not be less than 2,000 gallons. 
Structures with exposure hazards. For single and two-family dwellings not greater than 1,200 square feet in total area, including any attached structures, and with no portion of any attached structural exposure hazard closer than 50 feet (unless the attached structure is smaller than 100 square feet), the total water supply shall not be less than 3,000 gallons. For all other structures with unattached structural exposure hazards closer than 50 feet to any portion of the structure and larger than 100 square feet, the total water supply in gallons shall be determined by the total cubic footage of the structure, including any attached structures, divided by the occupancy hazard classification number determined from above and that quotient multiplied by 1.5. The Town Fire Marshal and the fire department or district having jurisdiction shall have the authority to allow variances to these requirements where specific individual conditions may require lesser amounts of water supply for exposure protection. However, the water supply required for any structure shall not be less than 3,000 gallons. 
Water supply. The total water supply required for firefighting purposes as determined by Subsection C(3)(a), (b) and (c) above may be supplied from various sources, including wells, hydrants, cisterns, swimming pools, ponds, lakes, streams and other man-made and natural sources or a combination of such sources. Such apparatus or water supplies shall be within 1,000 feet of any and all housing clusters on the road servicing such cluster or clusters under consideration. 
Post-calculation procedure. The Town Fire Marshal, after completing the site and structure survey specified above and computing the total water supply required, shall notify, in writing, the appropriate fire department and/or district of the results of the survey and of the total water supply required along with the proposed location for such water supplies. The data submitted shall include all calculations used to arrive at the total water supply, as well as all plans and other backup data used for the structural site survey. The fire department and/or district shall review said documents, and if they meet with their approval, they shall be transmitted to the Planning Board to be incorporated as part of the requirements for preliminary approval of the subdivision. They shall also notify the applicant as to the required water supplies and the location(s) of those supplies. The fire department and/or district and the Fire Marshal shall retain copies of all reports.

Urban Renewal Treatment of Old Filed Maps [Amended 5-15-2003 by L.L. No. 11-2003] 
§ 232-1-1. Short title. 
This chapter may be referred to as the "Town of East Hampton Urban Renewal Law." 
§ 232-1-2. Authority. 
This article is adopted as a local law pursuant to the authority of Article IX of the New York State Constitution; § 10 of the New York Statute of Local Governments; Article 2, § 10 of the New York Municipal Home Rule Law; the New York Eminent Domain Procedure Law; Article 15 ("Urban Renewal") of the New York General Municipal Law and related provisions of Chapter 402 of the Laws of 1961 enacting said Article; Articles 4 and 16 of the New York Town Law, including § 276 thereof concerning control of development in undeveloped filed subdivisions; and East Hampton Town Local Law No. 2 of 1976. 
§ 232-1-10. Findings. 
A. The findings of Local Law No. 2 of 1976 are hereby ratified and reaffirmed by the Town Board as if set forth fully herein. 
B. The Town Board finds that the unregulated development of certain old filed maps -poorly platted subdivision areas recorded with the County of Suffolk prior to the implementation of planning and zoning in East Hampton -poses a severe threat to the environmental and economic well-being of the community through potential large-scale over-development, over-clearing of land, over-crowding of population, depletion of resources, erosion of soil, pollution of lands and waters, and disruption of the goals of the Town's Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Code. 
C. It is further found that such old filed map areas constitute "substandard or unsanitary areas" as that term is defined in § 502 of Article 15 of the General Municipal Law, since such old filed map areas meet the criteria set forth by the State Legislature in § 1 of Chapter 402 of the Laws of 1961, in that, among other things, such areas are characterized by one or more of the following conditions which hamper or impede their safe and proper development: 
(1) 
Excessive land coverage. 

(2) 
Excessive population density. 

(3) 
Poorly or improperly designed street patterns and intersections. 

(4) 
Inadequate access. 

(5) 
Traffic congestion hazardous to the public safety. 

(6) 
Lack of suitable off-street parking. 

(7) 
Impractical street widths, sizes and shapes. 

(8) 
Blocks and lots of irregular form, shape or insufficient size, width or depth. 


§ 232-1-10 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 232-1-30 
(9) Unsuitable topography, subsoil or other physical conditions. 
D. Modernization and redesign of old filed maps by the Town, through the application of a carefully structured urban renewal and regulatory process, can ameliorate or alleviate each of these serious potential problems, while at the same time assuring for every individual lot owner in such old filed map areas continued reasonable economic value for their land. 
§ 232-1-20. Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to continue and improve a comprehensive system of regulation providing for the redesign and proper development of old filed maps in the Town of East Hampton, such system having been first implemented by the Town Board in Local law No. 2 of 1976 and having been founded primarily on the recognized authority of a Town under the state Urban Renewal Law (Article 15 of the General Municipal Law) to prevent and, where necessary, eliminate areas of substandard, unsanitary or unsafe land use in the Town. 
§ 232-1-30. Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
ACQUISITION  The obtaining of title by the Town of East Hampton to property comprising all or part of a designated Urban Renewal Area, either to hold for public purposes or for reconveyance as provided for in this chapter. Any such acquisition shall also constitute an "acquisition" as defined in § 103 of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law and an "acquisition of property" as authorized by § 506 of the General Municipal Law. 
ACQUISITION FEE  A fee of $5,000, or such other amount as may be set from time to time by Town Board resolution, representing the approximate average cost to the Town of counsel fees incurred in the acquisition and reconveyance of lots in Urban Renewal Areas, and not including costs for filing fees, surveys, appraisals, publication and similar out-of-pocket costs. 
ADMINISTRATOR  Any Town employee, including the Town Attorney, or any special counsel, consultant, contractor or other person or persons hired, appointed or designated by the Town Board to administer or assist in the administration of this chapter, or to perform the function assigned to the "Administrator" hereunder.

TOWN BOARD  The East Hampton Town Board. Such Board shall for the purposes of this chapter constitute the "governing body" to carry out the urban renewal functions provided for herein, both as defined in § 502 of the General Municipal Law. 
URBAN RENEWAL AREA  An old filed map, or one or more portions of such a map, which the Town Board, pursuant to § 504 of the General Municipal Law and this chapter, designated as appropriate for urban renewal treatment, after public notice and hearing. 
URBAN RENEWAL PARCEL ("URP")  Any lot or parcel shown on an Urban Renewal Map and having a parcel number assigned by that map. 
URBAN RENEWAL PLAN ("PLAN")  A comprehensive plan, map, plat, or treatment for an identified Urban Renewal Area officially adopted by majority vote of the Town Board after public notice and hearing, which may show some or all of the following: existing ownership patterns; roads to be improved, widened, partially opened or abandoned; drainage areas and improvements; areas to be dedicated, or over which easements are to be given; placement of hydrants, fire wells, cisterns or other similar improvements; important natural features and topography, together with mandated scenic easements or open spaces required to protect the same; proposed parks or public acquisitions; urban renewal parcels; assigned road improvement units and other prebuilding requirements for lot owners; as well as other features or details customarily shown on modem subdivision maps. Urban renewal parcels whose creation will involve modified lot lines, lot combinations or the like, shall be clearly shown in order to indicate areas where Town acquisition and reconveyance of property will be required to carry out the Plan in the event voluntary compliance therewith does not occur. 
§ 232-1-40. Designation of urban renewal areas. 
From time to time, upon report and recommendation of the Planning Board, the Town Board may designate all or a portion of any old filed maps in the Town of East Hampton as an 
§ 232-1-40 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 232-1-50 
Urban Renewal Area. However, no such designation shall be made except upon a finding by the Board, made after a public hearing held on 10 days' notice, that the area to be so designated is characterized by one or more of the substandard, unsanitary, unsafe, deteriorated or blighted conditions identified by the State Legislature in § 1 of Chapter 402 of the Laws of 1961; provided, however, that the Board need not determine that such conditions affect every individual property within the designated area. 
§ 232-1-50. Adoption of Urban Renewal Plans. 
A. Planning Board recommendation. As a part of any report and recommendation which it makes to the Town Board pursuant to the preceding section, the Planning Board shall include a recommended Urban Renewal Plan (also know as an "Urban Renewal Map") for the proposed Urban Renewal Area. 
B. Initial review by Town Board. The Town Board shall review the Plan recommended to it by the Planning Board, including specifically all lot line modifications, lot combinations or other similar elements of the Plan which could potentially require the use of eminent domain by the Town under this chapter, After its review, the Town Board may accept or modify the proposed Plan, or cause a Plan of its own to be prepared. It shall send the accepted Plan back to the Planning Board for public hearing. 
C. Planning Board hearing and certifications. The Planning Board shall promptly schedule a public hearing on at least 10 days' notice to consider the proposed Urban Renewal Plan. After such hearing, the Planning Board, pursuant to § 505(2) of the General Municipal Law, shall certify whether the Plan conforms to the findings made by the Town Board in designating the Urban Renewal Area pursuant to General Municipal Law § 504, conforms to the Town Comprehensive Plan, is consistent with local land use objectives, and otherwise complies with § 502(7) of the General Municipal Law. As promptly as possible, and in no case later than 10 weeks after the date of the referral of the Plan to it, the Planning Board shall submit these certifications to the Town Board, together with its recommendation to approve, disapprove or approve with modifications, the Plan. 
D. Town Board action. After a public hearing, held on at least 10 days' notice and not earlier than four weeks after the above certifications are received or due from the Planning Board, the Town Board may approve and adopt the Urban Renewal Plan in the manner provided for in § 505(3) of the General Municipal Law. If, in light of evidence adduced at its public hearing, the Town Board intends to make substantial modifications to the Plan as heard, the Town Board shall hold an additional public hearing. Notice of any hearing held pursuant to this subsection shall comply with § 202 of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law. Conduct of such hearing shall comply with§ 203 of said Law. The determinations and findings of the Town Board after such hearings shall comply with the requirements of § 204 of said law. In its resolution adopting any Urban Renewal Plan, the Town Board shall also make the findings required by § 505(4) of the General Municipal Law. 
E. Compliance with SEQRA. Before approving and adopting any Urban Renewal Plan, the Town Board shall act as lead agency and shall comply with all applicable provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act. In the event a hearing is required to be held by the Board under that act, the same may be combined and held jointly with the hearing referred to in the preceding section. 
F. Required compliance. Every resolution of the Town Board approving and adopting an Urban Renewal Plan should state that all future improvements in the affected Urban Renewal Area are to be in accordance therewith. 
G. Road improvement units. Explicit assignments of road improvement units shall be an integral part of any Urban Renewal Plan approved and adopted by the Town Board. RIU's shall be assigned in a uniform fashion to all vacant URP's in a plan, or to identifiable classes of URP's sharing similar characteristics, in order to assure that when building is completed within the boundaries of any Plan, all necessary public improvements shown on the approved Plan shall have been completed, and the costs of such improvements shall have been equitably distributed therein. A change in the number of RIU's assigned to any property shall constitute a modification of the Urban Renewal Plan which shall not be undertaken except in accordance with the procedures for such modifications set forth in § 232-1-70 hereof. 
§ 232-1-60. Effect of adoption of Urban Renewal Plan. 
The following shall apply to any and all property located in any Urban Renewal Area for which an Urban Renewal Plan shall have been approved and adopted by the Town Board: 
A. Permits -URP conformity. No building permit, natural resources special permit, certificate of occupancy, variance or other Town authorization, approval or permit shall be issued in connection with the use of any property, unless and until the boundary lines of such property conform with those shown on the Urban Renewal Plan for a numbered Urban Renewal Parcel and all other requirements of the Urban Renewal Plan, including any required dedication or grant of easement to the appropriate fire or fire protection district for the siting of fire-fighting improvements, have been met by the URP owner. Where two or more adjoining URP's are commonly owned, both can be eligible for building permits under this subsection, but no URP owned in common with an adjoining property that does not conform to applicable URP lot lines shall be so eligible. 
B. Permits -RIU compliance. No Town authorization, approval or permit shall be issued in connection with the construction or occupancy of any principal building, including a residence, on any vacant urban renewal parcel until the owner thereof shall have made proper application to the Town Planning Board for a determination as to the specific work and improvements to be required by the Planning Board to satisfy the Urban Renewal Plan RIU assignment for his property, and shall then have completed such work or improvements to the satisfaction of the Town Engineer. The Planning Board in its determination may permit the owner to execute an undertaking in favor of the Town, secured for no less than the dollar amount of his RIU assignment, in order to obtain a building permit prior to actually carrying out the required RIU work. However, no certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Building Inspector in any case until all work determined to be required by the Planning Board shall have been satisfactorily accomplished, and any property dedication or easement required of the lot owner by the Urban Renewal Plan or by the Planning Board shall have been carried out. 
C. Roads. No public or private road or street, nor any platted right-of-way of any description, shall be cleared, opened, extended, widened, paved, improved or used for access by any party, including any governmental entity, public authority or utility corporation, except as depicted on the approved Urban Renewal Plan. 
D. Jurisdiction. The Town Board shall retain exclusive jurisdiction with regard to the layout 
§ 232-1-60 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 232-1-80 
of lots, streets, drainage structures, utilities and other improvements in any Urban Renewal Area for which an Urban Renewal Plan has been adopted. The Planning Board may issue subdivision approvals or subdivision waivers for property included in any such approved Plan, subject to and conditioned upon the Town Board's determination to amend the Urban Renewal Plan. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall issue no variances authorizing or resulting in changes to streets, access, frontage, road improvement units or any other specific feature or requirements of any such plan, or of this chapter, with the exception of variances for lot line configurations, divisions, diminishments or expansions of any lot, which shall be subject to and conditioned upon the Town Board's determination to amend the Urban Renewal Plan. [Amended 9-20-2005 by L.L. No. 29-2005] 
E. Relationship to other laws. Unless specifically contravened by an element of an approved Urban Renewal Plan, the provisions of Chapter 102 (Building Construction), Chapter 255 (Zoning) and all other provisions of the Town Code with regard to permitted and specially permitted land uses, building sizes, setbacks, environmental protection, firesafety, etc. shall apply to all properties in any Urban Renewal Area, and all landowners in any such area shall comply with all such Code provisions in addition to the regulations contained herein, or implemented hereunder. 
§ 232-1-70. Modification of Urban Renewal Plans. 
A. Consideration of modifications. At the request of the Town Planning Board or Town Engineer, any affected landowner, or on its own motion, the Town Board may consider modification of any previously approved Urban Renewal Plan to show amended lot lines, lot layout, revised lot combinations, new lots, reconfigured streets, fire-fighting dedications, open spaces or improvements, changed RIU requirements, or other Plan elements. In all cases, the Board shall conduct a public hearing on 10 days' notice before it acts.

§ 232-1-80. Dissemination of information. 
It is the intent of the Town that owners of properties in designated Urban Renewal Areas understand their rights and obligations under the law. To this end, the Building Inspector shall maintain in his office and supply to any party requesting the same, copies of this local law, copies of Urban Renewal Plans approved and adopted by the Town, and any pamphlet, brochure, fact sheet or other similar informational document which shall have been approved by the Town Board for distribution to landowners in old filed maps/Urban Renewal Areas of the Town. 
§ 232-1-90. Dispute resolution. 
A. Initial complaint to Town. Any party (the "originating party") believing that he or she is unable to obtain a building permit because of the existence of a dispute as defined herein, may notify the Town of this contention, by filling out and submitting to the Building Inspector the official Town form provided for this purpose (the "originating form"). The Building Inspector shall supply the originating party with all informational documents then being maintained in the Building Inspector's office, which shall include a statement describing the purposes of this article and the dispute resolution procedures, and the Building Inspector shall mail the same materials and the originating form, certified mail, return receipt requested, to all other parties to the dispute identified on the originating form. For this purpose the Building Inspector shall use the tax roll addresses for all parties. 
B. Request for mediation. Not less than 45 days after the mailings referred to in the preceding subsection, the originating party or any other party to the alleged dispute may file with the Building Inspector a request for mediation, on the official form provided by the Town for this purpose. If no party to the alleged dispute files a request for mediation within the time allowed, the dispute shall be considered closed and no party may file an originating form or a request for mediation for a period of one year thereafter. 
C. Review by Administrator. Within 14 days of his receipt of a timely filed request for mediation, the Building Inspector shall forward such request for mediation to the Administrator, who shall do the following: 
(1) 
Examine each form and evaluate the underlying situation to determine whether a dispute exists. The Administrator shall not find that a dispute exists unless the originating party has made at least one bona fide offer in writing to another party to buy property at a reasonable price to achieve compliance with the Urban Renewal Plan. 

(2) 
If the Administrator determines that no bona fide offer has yet been made, or that offers made have not yet been refused, or otherwise that no Dispute exists, the Administrator shall so inform all parties in writing, and shall suggest a course of action for the parties to follow. 

(3) 
If the Administrator finds that a dispute exists, he or she shall endeavor to resolve the dispute amicably. To this end, the Administrator may contact or meet with one or more of the parties to the dispute and may serve as an intermediary or negotiator between such parties in order to facilitate and expedite the land transactions or other agreements between them necessary to achieve compliance with the controlling Urban Renewal Plan. The Administrator also may recommend to the Town Board the negotiated purchase of property from one or more of the parties, including for reconveyance to another landowner if required. The negotiating period shall not exceed six months and may be terminated at any time by the Administrator. 

(4) 
In cases where the Town Board has authorized acquisition and reconveyance of property prior to January 1, 2003, the Administrator shall (a) inform the Board of that 


§ 232-1-90 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 232-1-90 
prior determination, and (b) give such weight to that earlier determination, and to the length of time that has passed since that earlier determination was made, as the Administrator shall deem appropriate in formulating his or her recommendation to the Town Board. 
D. Buy/sell offer. 
(1) 
If the mediation referred to in § 232-1-90C above does not result in voluntary agreement between all parties and settlement of the dispute between them, the Administrator shall give the originating party 15 days to make a written offer, which offer shall contain both an offer to buy the property of the other party or parties to the dispute and an offer to sell his or her property to the other party or parties, at the same price per square foot (a "buy/sell offer"). 

(2) 
If the originating party does not make a "buy/sell offer" within the time allotted, the Administrator shall give the other party or parties 15 days to make a buy/sell offer to the originating party. 

(3) 
If no party makes a Buy/Sell Offer, the Dispute shall be deemed closed, and Administrator shall so inform the Town Board and shall recommend whether or not the Town should proceed as set forth in § 232-1-90G, below. 

(4) 
The recipient(s) of a buy/sell offer shall have 15 days to accept it by agreeing in writing either to sell his or her (or their) property or to buy the offeror' s property at the offered price and the parties shall enter into a contract of sale within 30 days thereafter. 

(5) 
If a buy/sell offer is not accepted by the recipient (or by all the recipients, if there is more than one), the Administrator shall recommend to the Town Board that it acquire by eminent domain the property of the recipient(s) and reconvey it to the offering party. The buy/sell offer shall be considered part of settlement negotiations and, therefore, not admissible in the condemnation proceeding. 

(6) 
If a buy/sell offer is accepted but the parties do not enter into a contract of sale within 30 days, the Administrator shall recommend whether (a) the Town Board should condemn the property of one the parties for reconveyance to the other(s), (b) the Town Board should proceed as set forth in § 232-1-90G, below, or (c) the dispute should be deemed closed and one or more of the parties be barred from filing an originating form or request for mediation for such period of time as the Town Board may determine in its discretion. 

(7) 
All buy/sell offers, acceptances, contracts and other written communications sent by any party to any other party pursuant to this Subsection D shall be sent by facsimile transmission, certified first class mail or overnight delivery service such that they are received by the recipient within the time periods established by this Subsection D, and copies shall be sent to the Administrator at the same time and by the same method as they are sent to a party or parties. 


E. Action by Town Board. The Town Board shall promptly consider the recommendations of the Administrator with regard to the resolution by condemnation of any dispute. Whether the Board agrees with the recommendation of the Administrator, does not agree with the recommendations of the Administrator, or is considering the condemnation of properties other than those recommended by him, it shall conduct a public hearing on ten days' notice, including a notice to all parties by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall make specific findings supporting its position before acting, as provided for in Article 2 of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law. 
F. Reconveyance. 
(1) 
For the purpose of implementing an Urban Renewal Plan, properties acquired hereunder by the Town of East Hampton may be retained by the Town, auctioned to the highest bidder, reconveyed to adjoining property owners or third parties, or otherwise lawfully disposed of. All reconveyances shall be for consideration. 

(2) 
The transferee shall pay to the Town an amount in cash equal to the price paid, or agreed to be paid, by the Town to the former owner of the property pursuant to negotiation, or paid by the Town as full payment or as advance payment pursuant to § 304 of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law ("advance payment"), together with the acquisition fee previously established by the Town Board and all out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Town in connection with the condemnation and reconveyance of the property, including without limitation costs of publication, appraisal, survey, title and prorated taxes. 

(3) 
The transferee shall remain liable to the Town for the full amount paid by the Town for the property even if that amount is not determined at the time of reconveyance, and, in that event, the transferee shall execute an agreement acceptable to the Town Attorney to pay such full amount to the Town and granting the Town a security interest and lien on the property to secure such payment. The amount of the lien shall be determined by the Town but no greater than 50% of the advance payment. 

(4) 
The Town Board may require that before it initiates any condemnation of property for reconveyance hereunder, the proposed transferee shall have entered into a conditional contract of purchase with the Town for the property, agreeing therein to pay the above consideration to the Town for the property and shall have paid the Town in advance the acquisition fee and the estimated costs of appraisal, survey and publication. 


G. No proper transferee. In the event no party to a dispute is willing to enter into an agreement with the Town to accept and pay for the reconveyance to him or her of property acquired by the Town from other parties to the dispute, the Town may condemn the property of all the parties and reconvey the same by auction or to a designated sponsor as permitted by § 507 of the General Municipal Law, in order to achieve the URP layout shown on the Urban Renewal Plan. 
H. Applicability to pending cases. The dispute resolution procedures provided for in this section shall apply to any matter currently before any Town official, employee or agency and qualifying as a dispute as defined herein. The Administrator shall review all such matters to determine their status and is hereby authorized to return any or all forms, requests, fees, etc. previously received by the Town with a request to one or more of the parties that all provisions of this chapter be complied with. In the alternative, the Administrator in suitable cases may deem there to have been substantial compliance with this section and may thereafter intervene in the dispute, or order mandatory mediation as the case may be, as provided for herein.

§ 232-2-10. Purpose. 
This article is enacted for the purpose of authorizing the purchase, renewal and redevelopment of the mobile home park and property known as the Three Mile Harbor Senior Citizens Trailer Park, which the Town Board finds to be a blighted and substandard property, and its reconveyance to a cooperative corporation consisting of residents of said Trailer Park or, if that is infeasible, to a private or public entity capable of managing the subject property as a mobile home park.

Chapter 250 AFFORDABLE HOUSING CREDIT PROGRAM 
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 5-4-2007 by L.L. No. 17-2007. Amendments noted where applicable.] 
GENERAL REFERENCES 
Conservation easements  See Ch. 16. Open space preservation  See Ch. 193. Building construction  See Ch. 102. Subdivision of land  See Ch. 220. Community preservation  See Ch. 112. Urban renewal  See Ch. 232. Farms and farming  See Ch. 134. Zoning  See Ch. 255. 
§ 250-10. Purpose and intent. 
A. The primary purpose of the East Hampton Affordable Housing Credit Program is to promote and facilitate the creation of affordable housing by the private and public sectors in the Town of East Hampton while at the same time enhancing the conservation of open space within the Town by permanently sterilizing certain lands purchased by the Town through the creation of conservation easements. The Comprehensive Plan (dated May 6, 2005) encourages the creation of apartments in commercial buildings to add to the affordable housing stock in the Town. The Comprehensive Plan also encourages the development of new affordable single-family housing developments and new attached affordable housing developments. 
B. The Comprehensive Plan suggests that a transfer of development rights program be established in order to facilitate the creation of affordable housing while at the same time complying with the groundwater protection standards of the Suffolk County Department of Health Services. By establishing the East Hampton Affordable Housing Credit Program, the Town will be able to transfer affordable housing credits from areas where the Town has sterilized land to other parcels for affordable housing projects throughout the Town. The affordable housing credits would be transferred from parcels of land in the Town of East Hampton which consist of natural, scenic, passive recreational, forest, or open land or sites of special historical, cultural, aesthetic or economic values sought to be protected. These parcels owned by the Town of East Hampton shall be permanently sterilized by conservation easements and/or covenants and restrictions to remain as open space. The affordable housing credits will allow recipients the opportunity to build developments or apartments consistent with the Town Code but that would otherwise not be allowed under Suffolk County Department of Health Services requirements. 
C. In order to determine the number of affordable housing credits that can be transferred from a subdividable parcel of land, a mathematical computation shall be prepared using the parcel acreage, the groundwater management zone and the residential zoning district where the property is located. The computation first requires the parcel acreage to be discounted by a factor of 25% to reflect the average amount of unbuildable land area on a typical parcel of land (i.e., land needed for roads or drainage solutions or that which is covered with constraints to building such as wetlands and excessively steep slopes). This discounted land area will be divided by the minimum lot area required in the groundwater management zone. For residential parcels zoned other than B and A Residence Districts, the number will be further reduced by a percentage based on Town zoning. 
D. Once the affordable housing credits are transferred for use in a project in the private or public sector, covenants and restrictions will be placed in the deed to assure the housing project remains affordable. Owners will be required to update their current septic systems to accommodate the greater usage because the septic systems for the affordable housing projects still must meet current Suffolk County Department of Health Services septic flow standards. To facilitate this requirement, the Town of East Hampton, where necessary or preferred from a planning standpoint, may allow owners to utilize Town rights-of-way, alleys, and parking lots to accommodate the upgraded septic system. 
§ 250-20. Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS  For the purpose of this chapter, the sanitary rights permitted on a lot, parcel, or area of land under the Suffolk County Department of Health Services. 
DEVELOPMENT YIELD  Is established by multiplying the gross lot area of the sending parcel by the development yield factor for each zoning category. 
EAST HAMPTON AFFORDABLE HOUSING CREDIT  A single-family residential density wastewater design flow equivalent of 300 gallons per day. 
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ZONES  Areas identifying differences in regional hydrogeologic and groundwater quality conditions as adopted by the Suffolk County Board of Health. East Hampton is divided between Groundwater Management Zones IV and V as depicted on a map filed in the Office of the Commissioner of Health in Hauppauge, New York and the East Hampton Town Planning Department. 
RECEIVING DISTRICT  One or more designated districts or areas of land having access to public water to which development rights generated from one or more sending districts may be transferred and in which increased development, as per the Suffolk County Department of Health Services septic flow standards, is permitted to occur by reason of such transfer. 
SENDING DISTRICT  One or more designated districts or areas of land in which

development rights are designated for use in one or more receiving districts. 
SUFFOLK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES ('SCHDS') YIELD METHOD DETERMINATION  Parcel acreage (in square feet) multiplied by a factor of .75 (75%) divided by 20,000 square feet if the land is within Groundwater Management Zone IV and public water is available or 40,000 square feet for all other parcels. 
TRANSFER OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS  The process by which development rights are transferred from one lot, parcel, or area of land in any sending district to another lot, parcel or area of land in one or more receiving districts. 
URBAN RENEWAL PARCEL  Any parcel shown on an Urban Renewal Map and having a parcel number assigned by that map. 
§ 250-30. Allocation of East Hampton affordable housing credits. 
For the purpose of computing the allocation of East Hampton affordable housing credits, a parcel of land is defined as a separately assessed tax lot. 
§ 250-30-10. Method of allocation. 
Development yield is established by multiplying the gross lot area of the parcel by the development yield factor for each zoning category. The development yield factors for the various residential zoning categories are detailed in § 250-30-10.2 below. The development yield factors for property zoned other than residential are detailed in § 250-30-20 below. For purposes of both residentially and nonresidentially zoned land, one acre equals 43,560 square feet. 
§ 250-30-10.1. Fractional allocations. 
For the purposes of computing the allocation of East Hampton affordable housing credits, a fractional allocation of an East Hampton affordable housing credit shall be rounded downward to the nearest whole East Hampton affordable housing credit. 
§ 250-30-10.2. Development yield factors and computation for residentially zoned property. 
A. Lots located outside Urban Renewal Maps. 
(1) 
For legally pre-existing nonconforming (as to minimum lot area) lots existing as separate tax map parcels prior to 1981, located outside the boundaries of the Urban Renewal Maps, the number of East Hampton affordable housing credits allowed to be transferred is equal to one East Hampton affordable housing credit. 

(2) 
For legally conforming (as to minimum lot area) parcels of land located outside the boundaries of the Urban Renewal Maps, the number of East Hampton Affordable Housing Credits allowed to be transferred will be determined using the Suffolk County Department of Health Services ("SCDHS") yield method determination for determining lot yield, discounted by a factor corresponding to the Town residential zoning classification according to the following formulas: 

(a) 
For Residence Districts B and A: same formula as SCDHS. 

(b) 
For Residence District A2: 80% SCDHS yield determination. 




(c) 
For Residence District A3: 60% SCDHS yield determination. 

(d) 
For Residence District A5: 40% SCDHS yield determination. 

(e) 
For Residence District A10: 20% SCDHS yield determination. 


In no case shall a legally conforming parcel of land as described in this section receive less than one credit. See Figure 250-1 for sample computations.141 
B. Urban renewal parcels. 
(1) 
Urban renewal parcels may only be considered as sending districts if the municipality owns 100% of the urban renewal parcel. Any lot in an urban renewal parcel that was purchased without banking the development rights shall be excluded from the development yield calculus. 

(2) 
For nonconforming (as to minimum lot area) parcels within Urban Renewal Maps, the number of East Hampton affordable housing credits allowed to be transferred is equal to one East Hampton affordable housing credit, subject to any percentage reduction for lots in the parcel that were purchased without banking the development rights. 

(3) 
For legally conforming (as to minimum lot area) parcels within Urban Renewal Maps, the number of East Hampton affordable housing credits allowed to be transferred will be determined using the Suffolk County Department of Health Services ("SCDHS") yield method determination for determining lot yield, discounted by a factor corresponding to the Town residential zoning classification according to the formula set forth in § 250-30-10.2A(2), but in no case shall a legally conforming parcel of land as described in this section receive less than one credit, subject to any percentage reduction for lots in the parcel that were purchased without banking the development rights.

East Hampton Affordable Housing Credit ("EHAHC") Program Allocation Examples 
Example 1: A 1.54 acre parcel zoned for B Residence (one unit per 20,000 square feet) in Groundwater Management Zone IV with public water available.{((1.54 x 43,560) x .75)/20,000} = 2.51559. This is then rounded down to the nearest whole number or 2 EHAHCs. 
Example 2: A 2.00 acre parcel zoned for A Residence (one unit per 40,000 square feet) within Groundwater Management Zone IV with no public water available. {((2.00 x 43,560) x .75)/40,000} = 1.6335. This is then rounded down to the nearest whole number or 1 EHAHC. 
Example 3: A 7.89 acre parcel zoned for A2 Residence within Groundwater Management Zone V. {((7.89 x 43,560) x .75)/40,000} x .80 = 5.155326. This is then rounded down to the nearest whole number or 5 EHAHCs.

Example 4: A 10.53 acre parcel zone for A3 Residence within Groundwater Management Zone IV with no public water available. {((10.53 x 43,560) x .75)/ 40,000} x .60 = 5.1602265. This is then rounded down to the nearest whole number or 5 EHAHCs. 
Example 5: A 15.63 acre parcel zoned for A5 Residence within Groundwater Management Zone IV with public water available. {((15.63 x 43,560) x .75)/20,000} x .40 = 10.21264. This is then rounded down to the nearest whole number or 10 EHAHCs. 
Example 6: A 21.34 acre parcel zoned for A10 Residence within Groundwater Management Zone V. {((21.34 x 43,560) x .75)/40,000} x .20 = 3.485889. This is then rounded down to the nearest whole number or 3 EHAHCs. 
§ 250-30-20. Allocation for property zoned other than residential. 
For commercially zoned land, the number of affordable housing credits that can be transferred from a subdividable parcel of land will be calculated by a mathematical computation using the parcel acreage and the groundwater management zones. The lot area in acreage will be discounted by a factor of 25% to reflect the average amount of unbuildable land area on a typical parcel of land (i.e., land needed for roads or drainage solutions or that which is covered with constraints to building such as wetlands and excessively steep slopes.) This discounted land area will be further reduced by dividing it by 40,000 square feet in Groundwater Management Zone V or, if public water is available, 20,000 square feet in Groundwater Management Zone IV, as established by the Suffolk County Health Department. In no case shall a parcel of land as described in this section receive less than one credit. 
§ 250-30-30. Computation for increased intensity in receiving district. 
A. The number of single-family houses allowed to be constructed for every one East Hampton affordable housing credit allowed to be transferred is equal to one house. 
B. The number of apartments allowed to be constructed for every one East Hampton affordable housing credit is equal to one apartment. 
§ 250-30-40. Limitations on allocation. 
The following limitations shall apply to the allocation of East Hampton affordable housing credits: 
250-30-40.1. No allocation shall be made for any property for which the development rights have previously been fully used, or allocated for use, under this program or any other program. 
250-30-40.2. Partially improved properties shall receive a decreased allocation based upon the extent of improvement. The East Hampton affordable housing credit allocation for a parcel of land shall be reduced by one East Hampton affordable housing credit for each existing single-family unit on the parcel. The Planning Department will determine the percentage of decreased allocation for all other existing improvements on properties. Should there be any question as to the determination of East Hampton affordable housing credit allocation for partially improved properties; the Town of East Hampton shall submit such question to the Suffolk County Department of Health Services for a determination of the number of East Hampton affordable housing credits available for the parcel. 
§ 250-40. Eligibility for redemption of East Hampton affordable housing credits.

(2) 
Value: upon making an addition to the structure or undertaking a reconstruction, rehabilitation or other improvement of the structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure prior to making or undertaking the addition, reconstruction, rehabilitation or other improvement. For the purposes of this provision, if the addition, reconstruction, rehabilitation or other improvement is made following damage to the structure, the market value of the structure shall be that which it had before the damage occurred. The term does not, however, include either: 

(a) 
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety codes and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 

(b)

(1) 
Where the use has never previously been made subject to the provisions of this chapter regulating or limiting its "substantial expansion," when there is a "substantial expansion" under either Subsection A(1) or (2) above, of either the principal building or structures or of the aggregate of all buildings and structures on the lot. 

(2) 
Where the use has previously undergone a "substantial expansion" subject to the provisions of this chapter and has been regulated accordingly, when either:

(2) 
Tier One applications. 


(a) Timeline for review. 
[1] Co-location using an existing structure: 60 days. 
[2] Installation using a new or replacement structure: 90 days. 
[3] Review timeline: 
[a] Unless a written agreement between the applicant and the Town provides otherwise, for an initial application the Town planning staff designee shall review the siting application and notify the applicant on or before the 10th day after submission of the application that the application is materially incomplete, and clearly and specifically identify the missing documents or information and the specific rule or regulation creating the obligation to submit such documents or information. The comment notice shall identify the deficiencies in the application, which, if cured, would make the application complete. The shot clock date for siting application is determined by counting forward, beginning on the day after the date when the application was submitted, by the number of calendar days of the shot clock period. 
[b] The clock date calculation shall restart at zero on the date on which the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the Town to render the application complete or incomplete. 
[c] The wireless communication facility shall be deemed complete on resubmission if the resubmitted materials cure the original deficiencies indicated by the Town. 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(f) 
GENERAL PROVISIONS § 255-1-41 
[d] If the Town does not approve the application following resubmission, then the application shall be deemed incomplete, and the steps outlined in Subsection N(2)(b) through (c) will be followed until the application is deemed complete. 
The Town may deny an application for any of the following reasons: 
[1] Applicable codes; or 
[2] Town Code or objective design standards that concern public safety, traffic safety and aesthetic concerns for decorative Town utility poles, including reasonable and nondiscriminatory concealment requirements such as screening or landscaping for ground-mounted equipment; or 
[3] Public safety and reasonable spacing requirements concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment in a right-of-way, including ADA compliance; or 
[4] For small wireless facilities to be located in the right-of-way in a historic district, any historic preservation requirements as set forth in § 255-1-41N(13). 
[5] If the Town denies an application, then the Town must document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions on which the denial was based. The Town shall send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the Town denies an application. 
Batching. If a single application seeks authorization for multiple deployments, all of which fall within a Tier 1 review, then the presumptively reasonable period of time for the application for the applications as a whole is equal to that for a single deployment within that category. The Town may remove a small wireless facility from a consolidated application and treat separately small wireless facility locations for which incomplete information has been provided or that are denied. The Town will issue a separate permit for each location that is approved. 
All work within the Town rights-of-way is also subject to approval of a work permit for work that involves excavation, affects traffic patterns or obstructs vehicular traffic within or along the Town's rights-of-way. Any/all work in the public right-of-way is subject to approval of a permit. The provider shall comply with all the provisions and terms of the Code of Ordinances and the right-of-way work permit. 
As-built construction drawings shall be provided to the Town for all structures, equipment, cable, pipes and conduit located within a Town or public right-of­way, and within any Town-owned utility or multipurpose easement; and which must include, for fiber optic cable, the number of strands of fiber in the conduit. If any of the Town's utilities or other infrastructure is relocated within the right­of-way as part of the construction, the Town shall have final approval of the design and engineering of such relocated items. 
Rates for use of Town utility poles within the right-of-way. An applicant who 
§ 255-1-41 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-1-41 
places a small wireless facility on a utility pole within a right-of-way in accordance with this section shall: 
[1] Execute a license agreement with the Town; and 
[2] Pay to the Town an annual recurring rate as set forth in the Town of East Hampton Fee Schedule for the use of such utility pole. 
(g) Required permit provisions. Each permit issued by the superintendent of public works and each license agreement for small wireless facilities shall be made upon the condition that the applicant agree to the following conditions: 
[1] Indemnification. To the fullest extent allowed by law, both the wireless infrastructure provider and wireless services provider (for this subsection, collectively referred to as "provider") constructing, installing, operating, repairing, maintaining and using a small wireless facility shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Town, and its officials, agents, and employees from and against all suits, actions or claims of any character brought because of any injury or damage received or sustained by any person, persons or property arising out of, or resulting from, said provider's breach of any provision of law, including but not limited to any asserted negligent act, error or omission of the provider, or its agents or employees, arising from or relating to its small wireless facility. The indemnifications required hereunder shall not be limited by reason of the specification of any particular insurance coverage for any permit. The provider's obligations under this provision shall not terminate with the expiration or termination of its permit but shall survive it. 
[2] Dispute resolution. A court of competent jurisdiction located in Suffolk County, New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under this section applying the laws of the State of New York. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for co-location of small wireless facilities on utility poles within the right-of-way, the Town shall allow the collocating party to collocate on utility poles at annual rates as set forth in the Town of East Hampton Fee Schedule.

The following provisions shall apply to and govern all nonconforming buildings and structures, as the same are defined herein, wherever located. 
A. Expansion of nonconforming structures generally. A nonconforming building or structure lawfully existing on any lot, or a building or structure which lawfully exists on a nonconforming lot, may be enlarged, reconstructed, altered, restored, or repaired, in whole or part, provided that the "degree of nonconformity" is not thereby increased. For the purposes of this subsection, an increase in the "degree of nonconformity" shall include an 
§ 255-1-42 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-1-43 
increase in the amount of a nonconforming building's or structure's gross floor area which is located within a required setback area, or an increase in any portion of a building or structure located above the maximum height permitted or within the required pyramid law setback. 
B. Rule governing nonconforming uses. The provisions of this section do not apply to a building or structure which is used for a nonconforming use. The enlargement, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or repair of a building or structure used by a nonconforming use shall be governed by the provisions of § 255-1-40 hereof. 
C. Limitations on reconstruction. Reconstruction of a legally preexisting nonconforming building or structure shall be limited as follows: 
(1) 
Reconstruction of a nonconforming building or structure shall require the issuance of a natural resources special permit if such is mandated by § 255-4-20 and § 255-4-21 hereof. 

(2) 
Reconstruction of a nonconforming building or structure shall require a bluff line or dune crest setback variance if such is mandated by § 255-4-40 hereof unless such reconstruction is required as a result of accidental cause, including fire. "Accidental cause" shall not include flooding or erosion. 


§ 255-1-43. Nonconforming lots. [Amended 3-15-1991 by L.L. No. 4-1991; 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996] 
The following provisions shall apply to and govern all nonconforming lots, as the same are defined herein, wherever located: 
A. Proof of preexisting single and separate ownership. A nonconforming lot may be used and a building or structure may be erected thereon for use in accordance with all other applicable provisions of this chapter, the Town Code and other laws, rules and regulations if proof that the lot has been held in continuous single and separate ownership since before the date on which it became nonconforming is submitted to the Building Inspector. The Building Inspector may require an abstract of title to said lot, which abstract shall be in the usual form, shall be certified by an attorney or title company regularly doing such work in Suffolk County and shall contain a certification that, since the effective date of this chapter or the amendment thereto which renders the lot nonconforming, no contiguous property was ever owned by an owner of the subject lot. 
B. Merger of nonconforming lots. If at any time a nonconforming lot shall be held in the same ownership as one or more adjoining parcels, the lot shall lose its status as a nonconforming lot, except to the extent that the lot created by the merger of the adjoining parcels remains nonconforming with respect to one or more dimensional regulations of the district in which it is situated. No such merger shall occur, however, in the following cases: [Amended 8-5-2005 by L.L. No. 24-2005] 
(1) 
Merger by death. No merger shall hereafter result under this chapter where the ownership of a nonconforming lot becomes the same as the ownership of an adjoining parcel through the death of an individual owner of one of the parcels. 

(2) 
Improved nonconforming parcels. No merger shall hereafter result under this chapter where adjacent nonconforming lots that are both improved with single family 


residences are held in the same ownership. 
C. Town Trustee roads. Certain parcels within the Town may be traversed or bisected by ancient Town Trustee roads, streets or highways (hereafter, "Trustee roads") whose preexistence has not become generally known or recognized until relatively recently. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A hereof, therefore, in cases where a Trustee road separates a parcel of land into one or more lots and where the preexistence of the Trustee road has been claimed, proved, or acknowledged (e.g., by Trustee acceptance of a deed to the road) only since the enactment of this chapter, no nonconforming lot which results from the preexistence of the Trustee road may be used for a principal building (e.g., a single-family residence) or have such a building erected thereon. This provision shall not prevent the owner of any such lot from separately conveying the same; but no such conveyance shall entitle any transferee of the lot to erect a principal building thereon. In the event that both or all of the parcels separated by a Trustee road hereunder are nonconforming lots, the owner or owners of the lots or parcels may elect to use one such lot and no other for the erection or construction of a principal building. 
D. Yard setback relief. For any lawfully existing single and separate nonconforming lot and solely for the purpose of siting thereon one principal building and any lawful accessory structures, except swimming pools and tennis courts, the required side and rear yards shall be reduced as set forth below. This setback relief shall apply automatically but is subject to any greater setbacks which may be required for swimming pools, swimming pool decks, slabs, patios or equipment and tennis courts, and is also subject to the pyramid law restrictions of § 255-11-72D hereof. 
(1) 
Lack of width (four-tenths rule). In the case of a lot nonconforming as to lot width, the required side yards shall each be reduced to no less than 4/10 times 4/10 or 0.16 of the lot width. 

(2) 
Lack of depth (two-tenths rule). In the case of any nonconforming lot as described above, the required rear yard shall be the lesser of the rear yard required by § 255-11-10 for the district in which the lot is situated or a distance equal to 2/10 of the depth of the lot, measured by a line drawn perpendicular to the street line. 


§ 255-1-44. Emergency exception. 
No provision herein regarding nonconforming buildings, structures, lots or uses shall be deemed to prevent the restoration of a wall or other structural member of a building which shall have been declared unsafe by the Building Inspector, Fire Prevention Inspector or other Town officer authorized to make such a determination or by an engineer, architect or builder authorized by the Town Board to examine or pass on the same. 
§ 255-1-45. (Reserved)185

The Town Board, after holding a public hearing on 10 days' notice published in the official newspaper, may, by resolution, determine a particular use on a particular lot to constitute a nuisance hereunder. If, 10 days after notice of such determination is served upon the owner and/or the person in control of said lot by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, the activities found by the Town Board to constitute the nuisance shall not have ceased, the Board may, by resolution and without further hearing or notice, declare a violation of § 255-1-50 and of this chapter to exist, subject to the provisions of Article X hereof. 
§ 255-1-60. Relationship to other laws and land use restrictions. 
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be taken to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with the applicability within the Town of the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code or any rules or regulations adopted or issued thereunder or any other provision of law, ordinance or regulation now existing or which may be adopted in the future, when such provision is not in conflict with any of the provisions hereof; nor is it intended by this chapter to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between public or private parties. However, when this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings, structures, premises, lots or land than is imposed or required by any other provision of law, ordinance, regulation, easement, covenant or agreement, the provisions of this chapter shall control. Wherever the provisions of any other law, ordinance or regulation impose a greater restriction than this chapter, the provisions of such other law, ordinance or regulation shall control.

However, with regard to instruments in which the Town is not a party, the Building Inspector shall have no obligation to research records or obtain recorded instruments or other documents, and the obligation to enforce this section shall arise only in cases where a copy of the recorded instrument whose terms would be violated by the activity or work for which permission is sought has previously been submitted to the Building Inspector, either by mail or in person, by a resident, taxpayer or property owner of the Town. The authority granted by this section to the Building Inspector to withhold a building permit based upon the existence of a recorded instrument to which the Town is not a party shall be limited to 10 working days following the Inspector's receipt of the instrument or to 10 days following receipt of the building permit application, if such application is made after the instrument in question has been submitted. Upon the expiration of the applicable ten-day period, the Inspector shall be free to issue the requested permit or permits, provided that all other requirements have been met.

Temporary uses of land which are regulated as "special events" under Chapter 151 ("Special Event Permits") of this Code shall not constitute land uses subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
§ 255-1-70. Overcrowding of dwelling units prohibited. [Amended 7-21-2016 by L.L. No. 32-2016] 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, no person shall erect, construct, create or permit to come into being on any property in any district, dwelling units, as the same are defined herein, at a density of more than six units per acre of land.

§ 255-1-80. Lighting.186 
§ 255-1-81 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-1-83 
§ 255-1-81. Purpose. [Added 10-6-2006 by L.L. No. 27-2006; amended 7-3-2014 by L.L. No. 21-2014] 

The following provisions are intended to control and regulate exterior lighting throughout the Town to promote public safety on the Town's roads and highways, protect landowners from the intrusive effects of glare and light trespass, preserve the rural character of the Town, and maintain and restore the beauty of the night sky. Excessive, unshielded, and poorly directed exterior lighting has many adverse effects. It detracts from the rural qualities of East Hampton and makes the Town appear increasingly suburban and overdeveloped. Glare associated with such lighting is dangerous for drivers and pedestrians on the Town's roads at night. Furthermore, such lighting interferes with the privacy of residents, wastes energy resources, and creates skyglow, which makes the night sky less visible and diminishes the natural nocturnal environment for flora and fauna. The regulations set forth in this part take proper account of the legitimate uses of exterior lighting, while providing guidance and direction for landowners and businesses. 
§ 255-1-82. Applicability. [Added 10-6-2006 by L.L. No. 27-2006; amended 7-3-2014 by L.L. No. 21-2014]

The following shall apply to all exterior lighting within the Town: 
A. Exterior lighting shall be designed, installed, and maintained to minimize glare. 
B. Irrespective of any other provision herein, all lighting on new construction for which a building permit is issued after the adoption of this local law188 must be fully shielded. 
C. No light source, as defined in § 255-1-20, shall be visible beyond the boundary of the property on which the light source is located, including from a body of water or roadway. House lights, as defined in § 255-1-20, temporary lighting, as defined in § 255-1-20, and landscape lighting, as defined in § 255-1-20, shall be exempt from this provision. All lighting not specifically exempted herein shall be fully shielded. 
D. Prohibited lighting. The following types of lighting are prohibited: 
(1) 
Uplighting, except as specifically permitted herein; 

(2) 
Searchlights, including those that are transportable, except those used for governmental or emergency purposes;

A. Administrative permit. The Planning Department of the Town of East Hampton shall have the power to process and review applications and to approve, conditionally approve, modify or deny such permits for new lighting on a nonresidential site that is proposed to be installed in which site plan approval is not required pursuant to § 255-6-30B. String lighting on nonresidential property which does not comply with the General lighting standards set forth in § 255-1-83 of the Town Code may not be approved pursuant to this section and are prohibited unless exempt pursuant to § 255-1-83F(1) or (2). [Amended 2-7-2019 by L.L. No. 6-2019; 7-7-2022 by L.L. No. 20-2022] 
B. Jurisdiction. Except as provided for herein, the Planning Department shall exercise sole jurisdiction over administrative lighting permits and the review of applications received by the Town for the same. Such authority shall be exercised by the Department for and on behalf of the Planning Board, and except as otherwise specified herein, the determinations of the Planning Department with regard to administrative lighting permit applications, which it processes and decides under this section, shall have the same force and effect as if such applications had been reviewed and acted upon by the Planning Board. All applications must comply with the § 255-6-61 herein and the Town of East Hampton Planning Board Guidelines for Lighting. Grant of any such administrative permit shall constitute an action as defined in the Environmental Conservation Law and in the regulations promulgated by the State Department of Environmental Conservation under that law. 
C. Informal procedures. Unless specifically provided otherwise herein, review of applications for administrative lighting permits conducted by the Planning Department shall not include Architectural Review Board approval, involve the holding of formal public hearings, the taking of sworn or unsworn testimony, the making of transcripts or the keeping of minutes or other formal records of proceedings. The issuance or conditional issuance of an administrative lighting permit authorized herein by the Planning Department shall not require the making of formal findings or determinations by the Planning Department or by any other Town department or agency, except as may be required by the Environmental Conservation Law or Chapter 75 of the Town Code. 
D. Receipt of applications. All applications for administrative lighting permits shall be accepted for the Town by the Planning Department. An application pursuant to this section must include the following: 
(1) 
Elevation drawing(s) depicting the proposed light fixture; 

(2) 
A drawing that is drawn to scale and depicts the location of the existing and proposed fixtures in relation to the property lines; and 

(3) 
Lighting-manufacturer-supplied product information sheets that include photographs of the fixture, "fully shielded" indication, and photometric data for the fixture, type of light source and initial lumen output. 


E. Initial staff review. The Planning Department shall review every application for completeness. Within 10 days after receipt of the application by the Town, the Planning Department shall issue a notice of complete application as specified below or a request to the applicant for additional information. Applications that are submitted with a "thirty-day 
§ 255-1-84 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-1-100 
insurance company letter" shall be processed first. 
F. Further staff review. The Department shall collect and compile all information necessary for an informed and thorough review of the application, shall conduct a site inspection and shall formulate its analysis and recommendations regarding proper disposition of the application. The Planning Department shall make a decision either to issue an administrative lighting permit or to refer the matter to the Planning Board for public hearing and decision because one or more of the conditions listed in § 255-6-30B are determined to exist. If for any such reason it is determined that a particular application cannot be further processed administratively by the Planning Department, the Planning Board shall be so informed by the Department, and the Board shall process the application in accordance with site plan procedures. 
G. Final administrative processing. If all conditions listed in § 255-6-30B are found not to exist, an administrative lighting permit may be prepared by the Department. This permit shall be mailed by the Planning Department with a cover letter informing the applicant that, unless a written request for modification of the draft permit or an objection to one or more conditions of the draft permit is made to the Planning Department within 10 days, the final permit will issue as originally drafted. Any objection or modification request so submitted shall be considered by the Planning Department, which may elect to modify the final permit accordingly. If such a modification is made, the final permit issued by the Planning Department shall reflect the modification; otherwise, it shall be identical to the originally issued draft. Final approval by the Planning Department of the installation is required and is contingent upon an inspection verifying that the installation is in compliance with the permit. 
H. Appeals; hearing de novo. An applicant may appeal the denial of an administrative permit application by the Planning Department or the imposition in any permit issued by the Department of one or more particular conditions. Any such appeal shall be deemed, procedurally and for all other purposes, an entirely new application to the Planning Board for a nonadministrative lighting permit, and the Planning Board shall hear and decide the matter on that basis. The Board may make use of documents and materials already submitted by the applicant or produced by the Planning Department. No new fee shall be charged an applicant for the further processing of the application.

ARTICLE III 
Overlay Districts 
§ 255-3-10. Overlay districts established. [Amended 10-6-1995 by L.L. No. 12-1995; 7-1-2005 by L.L. No. 19-2005; 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007; 10-19-2015 by L.L. No. 35-2015] 
For the purpose of applying additional uniform land use regulations to specific categories of land sharing certain important characteristics, there are hereby established the following overlay districts: 
A. Affordable Housing Overlay District (AHO). 
B. Agricultural Overlay District (AGO). 
C. Flood Hazard Overlay District (FHO). 
D. Limited Business Overlay District (LBO). 
E. Water Recharge Overlay District (WRO). 
F. Harbor Protection Overlay District (HPO). 
G. Coastal Erosion Overlay District (CEO). 
H. Recreational Overlay District (ROD). 
§ 255-3-11. Overlay district boundaries. 
The boundaries of overlay districts shall be as described in the text of this article, in other official public documents specifically referred to in such text, or as depicted on the Use District Map, being Article XII hereof, or any combination thereof. In interpreting the location of those boundaries which are shown on said Use District Map, the rules set out in § 255-2-20 hereof shall apply. 
§ 255-3-12. Effect of inclusion in overlay district. 
A lot or land included in any overlay district established hereunder shall continue to be included as well in the use district into which it has been placed pursuant to Article II and Article XII hereof. Except to the extent that one or more regulations of said use district is suspended or overridden by the specific language of an applicable overlay district regulation, all use district regulations affecting the use of the lot or land, and the use of buildings and structures and other activities thereon, shall continue to apply. Where an applicable use district regulation and an applicable overlay district regulation address the same subject matter, and one does not by its terms override or supersede the other, the regulation imposing the greater restriction on the use of the affected building, structure, lot or land shall control. 
§ 255-3-20. Affordable Housing Overlay District. 
§ 255-3-21. Purpose. 
The purpose of the Affordable Housing Overlay District is to designate the areas in East Hampton Town which are the most appropriate locations for the creation, through public and/ 
§ 255-3-21 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-35 
or private initiative, of attractive and affordable housing for senior citizens, young families and other persons of moderate means living in the Town. At the same time, the standards and safeguards necessary to assure that such development is compatible with its surroundings and with the character of the Town, and that such development is available to and benefits those persons for whom it is designed, can be established. In this way, it is intended that deserving citizens of the Town will be significantly assisted in finding adequate, convenient and affordable places to live, despite continually spiraling real estate values and housing costs. 
§ 255-3-22. Boundaries. 
The boundaries of the Affordable Housing Overlay District shall be as shown on the Use District Map. The same may be amended from time to time by local law. 
§ 255-3-25. Regulations. 
Notwithstanding any use or dimensional provision of Article XI of this chapter applicable to the use district in which it is located, a lot located wholly within the Affordable Housing Overlay District shall be eligible for use as the site of an affordable housing development, provided that a special permit authorizing the establishment of such affordable housing on the lot shall first have been obtained as provided for in Article V hereof. 
§ 255-3-30. Agricultural Overlay District. 
§ 255-3-31. Purpose. 
The purpose of the Agricultural Overlay District is to reasonably control and, to the extent possible, prevent the unnecessary loss of those currently open lands within the Town containing large and contiguous areas of prime agricultural soils. The economic, social and aesthetic benefits which can be obtained for all citizens by limiting loss of such areas are well documented and have inspired a host of governmental programs designed, with varying degrees of success, to achieve this result. For its part, the Town is expending large sums of money to protect existing farm acreage. At the same time, the Town has an obligation to exercise its authority to reasonably regulate the subdivision and development of this land to further the same purposes, while honoring the legitimate interests of farmers and other farmland owners. The Town of East Hampton Agricultural Land Study, prepared by the office of the Town Planner in 1981, provides important criteria for the boundaries of the Agricultural Overlay District and the regulations to be applied by the Town Board therein. 
§ 255-3-32. Boundaries. 
The boundaries of the Agricultural Overlay District shall be as shown on the Use District Map. The same may be amended from time to time by local law. 
§ 255-3-35. Regulations. [Amended 3-15-1991 by L.L. No. 4-1991; 9-17-1993 by L.L. No. 28-1993; 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996] 
In addition to any other provisions of this chapter applying to them, all lots, lands, buildings and other structures in the Agricultural Overlay District shall be subject to the following: 
A. Applicability of Town Open Space Preservation Law. No lot or land wholly or partly in the Agricultural Overlay District shall be subdivided, either by formal subdivision or by waiver, except as provided for in Chapter 193 of this Code. This subsection shall not be construed to limit the applicability of Chapter 193 to any other lot or land outside of the Agricultural Overlay District. 
B. Right to farm. The provisions of Chapter 134, Art. I, of this Code establishing an officially recognized right to farm in East Hampton Town shall be applicable to any agricultural use lawful under this chapter which is being carried out on land within the Agricultural Overlay District, whether or not said use is an activity or use specifically included in Chapter 134, Art. I. 
C. Architectural review in and adjacent to district. On any property wholly or partly in the Agricultural Overlay District or on any property fronting on the boundary line of such district or lying directly across any private or public street or right-of-way which borders such district, the Architectural Review Board shall have jurisdiction over buildings, structures, signs and exteriors as provided in Article VII of this chapter. 
D. Soil conservation. Except as part of a construction project for which all approvals required to be obtained under this Code have been granted, no Class I or Class II agricultural soil located on any lot wholly or partly within the Agricultural Overlay District shall be removed from such lot. 
E. Residential community facility uses prohibited. With the exception of "park," the residential community facility uses listed in Subsection B of § 255-11-10, Table I, "Use Table for Residential and Related Uses," shall be prohibited on any parcel of land which is located wholly or partly within the Agricultural Overlay District and which has a lot area of 10 acres or more. [Added 1-8-1999 by L.L. No. 1-1999] 
F. Site plan review. On any parcel of land which is located wholly or partly within the Agricultural Overlay District and which has a lot area of 10 acres or more, site plan review shall be required for the erection, construction or enlargement of any single-family residence not completed and in existence as of February 1, 1999, or any building or structure accessory thereto, and for the moving of any single-family residence whatsoever.

(d) 
Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures on slopes. 



D. 
Residential structures (coastal high-hazard areas). The following standards, in addition to the standards in § 255-3-44A(1), Coastal high-hazard areas, and (2), Subdivision proposals, and § 255-3-44B, Standards for all structures, apply to new and substantially improved residential structures located in areas of special flood hazard shown as Zones V1-V30, VE 


§ 255-3-44 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-44 
or V on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map designated in § 255-3-42B. 
(1) 
Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on pilings, columns or shear walls such that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member supporting the lowest elevated floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached to the piles or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other members designed to either withstand storm action or break away without imparting damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above two feet above base flood elevation so as not to impede the flow of water. 

(2) 
Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during the base flood on all building components. 

(a) 
The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves, current drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm debris. Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls, or other natural or man-made flow obstructions could cause wave runup beyond the elevation of the base flood. 

(b) 
Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure include windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on the roof, internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house, and upward force on the underside of the house when it is exposed. In the design, the wind should be assumed to blow potentially from any lateral direction relative to the house. 

(c) 
Wind loading values used shall be those required by the building code. 



(3) 
Foundation standards. 

(a) 
The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures acting simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be designed to transfer safely to the underlying soil all loads due to wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads (including uplift due to wind and water). 

(b) 
Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural support of a new building or substantial improvement of an existing structure. 



(4) 
Pile foundation design. 

(a) 
The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less than 8:1 for individual piles (this shall not apply to pile clusters located below the design grade). The maximum center-to-center spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on center under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders. 

(b) 
Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift) associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with typical structure (live and dead) loads and shall include consideration of decreased resistance capacity caused by erosion of soil 




strata surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for foundation piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum if the BFE is +10 msl or less or to be at least 10 feet below msl if the BFE is greater than +10 msl. 
(c) 
Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in column action from the bottom of the structure to the stable soil elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or diagonally braced to withstand wind and water forces. 

(d) 
The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of eight inches for round timber piles and eight inches by eight inches for square timber piles. All wood piles must be treated in accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and damage from fungus. 

(e) 
Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twenty-eight-day ultimate compressive strength of not less than 5,000 pounds per square inch and shall be reinforced with a minimum of four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than 1% nor more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for precast piles shall have a concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4 inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field shall have a concrete cover of not less than two inches. 

(f) 
Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer, jetted, or augered into place. 

(g) 
Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include lateral or diagonal bracing between piles. 

(h) 
When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both directions by a wood timber grade beam or a reinforced concrete grade beam. These at-grade supports should be securely attached to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath. 

(i) 
Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch-by-eight-inch (minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be limited in location to below the lowest supporting structural member and above the stable soil elevation and aligned in the vertical plane along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cable-type bracing is permitted in any plane. 

(j) 
Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the beam-to-pile connection, may be used along pile rows perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or four-by-four or larger braces framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall consist of two five-eighths-inch galvanized steel bolts (each end) for two-by-eight members, or one five-eighths-inch lag bolt (each end) for square members. Knee braces shall not extend more than three feet below the elevation of the base flood. 


(5) Column foundation design. Masonry piers or poured-in-place concrete piers shall be internally reinforced to resist vertical and lateral loads and be connected with a 
§ 255-3-44 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-44 
movement-resisting connection to a pile cap or pile shaft. 
(6) 
Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood connectors, or bolts of size and number adequate for the calculated loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a structure. Toe nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All metal connectors and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be steel, hot-dipped galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in protected interior locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet. 

(7) 
Beam to pile connections. The primary floor beams or girders shall span the supports in the direction parallel to the flow of potential floodwater and wave action and shall be fastened to the columns or pilings by bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members shall be connected by reinforcement, if cast in place, or (if precast) shall be securely connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams, or girders are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two five-eighths-inch galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/16 inch by four inches by 18 inches each bolted with two one-half-inch lag bolts per beam member shall be used. Notching of pile tops shall be the minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam members without unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall not be notched so that the cross section is reduced below 50%. 

(8) 
Floor and deck connections. 

(a) 
Wood two-inch-by-four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist anchors shall be used to tie floor joists to floor beams/girders. These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a minimum. Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided. Such cross bridging may be one-inch-by-three-inch members, placed eight feet on center, maximum, or solid bridging of same depth as joist at same spacing. 

(b) 
Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide good torsional resistance in the horizontal plane of the structure. The plywood should not be less than three-fourths-inch total thickness and should be exterior grade and fastened to beams or joists with 8d annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such fastening shall be supplemented by the application of waterproof industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces. 



(9) 
Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required breaks under a wall stud or an anchor bolt. Approved anchors will be used to secure rafters or joists and top and bottom plates to studs in exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie. Continuous 15/32-inch or thicker plywood sheathing--overlapping the top wall plate and continuing down to the sill, beam, or girder--may be used to provide the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood are not vertically continuous, then two-by­four nailer blocking shall be provided at all horizontal joints. In lieu of the plywood, galvanized steel rods of one-half-inch diameter or galvanized steel straps not less than one inch wide by one-sixteenth-inch thick may be used to connect from the top wall plate to the sill, beam, or girder. Washers with a minimum diameter of three inches shall be used at each end of the one-half-inch round rods. These anchors shall be installed no more than two feet from each corner rod, no more than four feet on center. 

(10) 
Ceiling joist/rafter connections. All ceiling joists or rafters shall be installed in such a manner that the joists provide a continuous tie across the rafters. Ceiling joists and 


rafters shall be securely fastened at their intersections. A metal or wood connector shall be used at alternate ceiling joist/rafter connections to the wall top plate.

(c) 
In addition, roofs should be sloped as steeply as practicable to reduce uplift pressures, and special care should be used in securing ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, vents, chimneys, and other points of discontinuity in the roofing surface. Lower pitched structures will be permitted if designed or reviewed and certified by a registered professional engineer or architect. 



(13) 
Protection of openings. All exterior glass panels, windows, and doors shall be designed, detailed, and constructed to withstand loads due to the design wind speed of 75 miles per hour. Connections for these elements must be designed to transfer safely the design loads to the supporting structure. Panel widths of multiple-panel sliding glass doors shall not exceed three feet. 

(14) 
Breakaway wall design standards. 

(a) 
The breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and not more than 20 pounds per square foot, with the criterion that the safety of the overall structure at the point of wall failure be confirmed using established procedures. Grade beams shall be installed in both directions for all piles considered to carry the breakaway wall load. Knee braces are required for front-row piles that support breakaway walls. 

(b) 
Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per square foot shall not be permitted unless a registered professional engineer or architect has developed or reviewed the structural design and specifications for the building foundation and breakaway wall components and certifies that 1) the breakaway walls will fail under water loads less than those that would occur during the base flood, and 2) the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system will not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage 




§ 255-3-44 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-44 
due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be those required by the building code. 
E. Nonresidential structures (except coastal high-hazard areas). The following standards apply to new and substantially improved commercial, industrial and other nonresidential structures located in areas of special flood hazard, in addition to the requirements in § 255-3-44A(2), Subdivision proposals, and (3), Encroachments, and § 255-3-44(B), Standards for all structures.

202.Editor's Note: "This local law" refers to L.L. No. 23-2009, adopted 9-8-2009. 
§ 255-3-45 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-45 
is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of this local law. 
(3) 
Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. 

(4) 
In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this local law and: 

(a) 
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 

(b) 
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 

(c) 
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage, and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 

(d) 
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 

(e) 
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 

(f) 
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 

(g) 
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 

(h) 
The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program of that area; 

(i) 
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 

(j) 
The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with conducting search-and-rescue operations during periods of flooding; 

(k)

(5) 
Upon consideration of the factors of § 255-3-45A(4) and the purposes of this local law, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this local law. 

(6) 
The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 

B. 
Conditions for variances. 

(1) 
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, providing Items (a) through (l) of § 255-3-45A(4) above, have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 

(2) 
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon determination that: 

(a) 
The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure"; and 

(b) 
The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 



(3) 
Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that: 

(a) 
The criteria of § 255-3-45B(1), (4), (5), and (6) are met; and 

(b) 
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threat to public safety. 



(4) 
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 

(5) 
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 

(6) 
Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of: 

(a) 
A showing of good and sufficient cause; 

(b) 
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 

(c) 
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 



(7) 
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from lowest floor elevation. 




§ 255-3-50. Limited Business Overlay District. 
§ 255-3-51 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-55 
§ 255-3-51. Purpose. [Amended 5-6-2005 by L.L. No. 15-2005; 10-6-2006 by L.L. No. 24-2006] 
The purpose of the Limited Business Overlay District is to permit the introduction and continuance of a limited class of low-intensity business uses on certain residentially zoned properties lying immediately adjacent to sections of the Montauk Highway and North Main Street, East Hampton. A central objective of sound community planning is the prevention of strip commercial development or sprawl along major arteries. Such development, if unchecked, can result in traffic congestion, energy wastage, air pollution and economic disruption of established commercial centers, as well as suburbanization, aesthetic blight and loss of community character. For this reason, most business land uses are best located in villages and neighborhood centers, with residential uses predominating elsewhere. However, it is recognized that as is common in many rural areas, the Town's highways have for many years contained a small scattering of commercial uses at the edges of and in-between the hamlets. There is a fine line between this pattern of the "rural highway" and "suburban sprawl" that can easily be crossed if highway businesses increase too much in number or intensity. The locations and regulations of the Limited Business Overlay District have thus been crafted to maintain this delicate balance. The additional uses permitted must generate only low amounts of traffic and must be designed and must function so as to protect nearby residential uses and the essential residential character of the district and the community as a whole. 
§ 255-3-52. Boundaries. [Amended 5-6-2005 by L.L. No. 15-2005] 
The Limited Business Overlay District shall include any lot which was in single and separate ownership on the effective date of this section and fronts on a section of the Montauk Highway (State Route 27) or North Main Street, East Hampton, marked on the Use District Map203 as limited business frontage by the limited business eligibility line. 
§ 255-3-53. Existing commercial uses. [Added 11-7-2006 by L.L. No. 32-2006; amended 10-2-2014 by L.L. No. 34-2014] 
The limitations and requirements set forth in Town Code §§ 255-3-57C and 255-3-58 shall apply to construction of a new commercial structure or conversion of an existing residential structure to a commercial use but shall not apply to legally preexisting commercial structures within the Limited Business Overlay District that are converted to another commercial use, provided that no preexisting commercial structures, 2,000 square feet or more in gross floor area shall be increased in size. 
§ 255-3-55. Regulations. 
In lieu of any use permitted in the residential district in which it is included, a use listed in Article XI as a special permit use in Limited Business Overlay District (LBO) may be constructed, undertaken or carried out on any property within such district, provided that: 
A. A special permit is obtained for the use pursuant to Article V hereof; 
B. Site plan review approval is obtained from the Planning Board pursuant to Article VI hereof; and 
203.Editor's Note: The Use District Map is included as an attachment to this chapter. 
C. Architectural and design review approval is obtained from the Architectural Review Board pursuant to Articles VI and VII hereof. 
§ 255-3-57. Limitations. 
A. Depth. Limited business uses shall only be permitted on that portion of an eligible lot which lies within 200 feet of the Montauk Highway or North Main Street right-of-way property line. [Amended 5-6-2005 by L.L. No. 15-2005] 
B. Existing residence. On an eligible lot with an existing residence, any point of which lies within 150 feet of the Montauk Highway or North Main Street right-of-way property line, only limited business uses which are to be housed in, incorporate or make use of the existing residence shall be permitted, and no limited business use which entails the demolition, moving or removal of the residence shall be approved. However, renovation, rehabilitation and/or expansion of the residence in order to accommodate a limited business use may be authorized. [Amended 5-6-2005 by L.L. No. 15-2005] 
C. Gross floor area. A combined maximum of 2,000 square feet of the total gross floor area of all structures on the parcel may be used for a commercial use. The remaining gross floor area may be utilized for storage or an affordable apartment. New construction of a structure for a commercial use is limited to a maximum total gross floor area of 2,000 square feet. 
[Added 10-6-2006 by L.L. No. 24-2006;204 amended 11-17-2006 by L.L. No. 32-2006; 10-2-2014 by L.L. No. 34-2014] 
D. Subdivision. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, after the effective date of this section, within the Limited Business Overlay District no new single and separate vacant lots shall be created unless at the time of such creation, the Planning Board requires, and the Town Board accepts, a recordable instrument limiting use of the newly created lot to single-family residential, open space or park purposes only. 
§ 255-3-58. Appearance standards. [Added 10-6-2006 by L.L. No. 24-2006] 
In addition to any other provisions of this chapter which may apply to them, lots, lands, buildings, structures, uses and activities proposing a limited business use shall be subject to the following standards, which are to be utilized by the Planning Board and the Architectural Review Board in reviewing the proposed use: 
A. No picture or display window shall be permitted along the street-facing side of the building. 
B. All lighting shall be residential in character and limited to the minimum required for safety. 
C. When practical, all additions to existing residential structures that have an existing limited business use shall be located to the rear (nonstreet) portion of the building. 
D. When practical, setbacks for all accessory structures shall be double that required for the underlying zoning district. 
E. When feasible, all parking shall be located to the rear (nontreet) portion of the building. Paved parking should, when practical, be limited to 50% of the parking requirement for the proposed use. The number of constructed parking spaces for a limited business use may be 
204.Editor's Note: This local law also redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection D. 
§ 255-3-58 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-58 
modified by the Planning Board pursuant to § 255-11-42J.

§ 255-3-60. Water Recharge Overlay District. 
§ 255-3-61. Purpose. 
The purpose of the Water Recharge Overlay District is to provide for the application of a system of needed additional regulations for properties located in areas where disproportionately large quantities of rainwater are recharged into and stored in the underground aquifer, in order to help ensure the continued sufficiency and purity of the Town's irreplaceable groundwater supply and sole source of drinking water. 
§ 255-3-62. Boundaries. 
The boundaries of the Water Recharge Overlay District shall be as shown on the Use District Map. The same may be amended from time to time by local law. 
§ 255-3-65. Regulations. 
In addition to any other provisions of this chapter which may apply to them, lots, lands, buildings and structures in the Water Recharge Overlay District shall be subject to the following: 
A. Subdivision. No lot or land wholly or partly within the overlay district shall be subdivided (unless by subdivision waiver) except pursuant to Chapter 193 of this Code. 
B. Critical area designation. Lands located within the overlay district are hereby declared to be critical areas of environmental concern pursuant to Chapter 128 of this Code. 
C. Conditional approvals. Any activity or use for which the approval of any local agency is needed may be approved by said agency conditioned upon the landowner's filing covenants and restrictions granting to the Town enforceable rights against overclearing of land, landscaping, the use of fertilizers, the manner of disposing of waste materials or any other reasonable condition or restriction necessary to ensure continued integrity of the Town's groundwater. 
D. Minimized clearing. In all their actions, local agencies shall minimize, to the extent practicable, clearing and grading of natural vegetation and disturbance of the natural contours of lands within the overlay district. 
E. Except as may be permitted on building lots within open space subdivisions created pursuant to Chapter 193, clearing of lots or parcels of land within the Water Recharge Overlay District shall be restricted as set forth herein. [Amended 9-1-1989 by L.L. No. 10-1989; 12-2-1994 by L.L. No. 15-1994; 11-6-1998 by L.L. No. 36-1998; 9-20-2001 by

(1) The total area of a lot which may be cleared of indigenous natural vegetation shall not exceed the following amounts for any lot located wholly or partly within the overlay district: 
§ 255-3-65 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-65 
Lot Area (square feet) Maximum Clearing Permitted 
In Residence Districts: Up to and including 39,999 10,000 square feet or 35% of lot area, whichever is greater 
From 40,000 to and including 10,000 square feet + (lot area X 12.5%) 280,000 Greater than 280,000 45,000 square feet 
In Commercial Districts: All lots 10,000 square feet or 50% of lot area, whichever is greater 
In calculating the amount of clearing permitted by this subsection on a flag lot or a lot which is burdened by a common driveway easement or access easement, the area of any flag strip or any common driveway easement or access easement shall be excluded from lot area. Likewise, any clearing for driveway purposes within the flag strip or within the common driveway easement or access easement shall not be counted into the permissible amount of clearing. 
(2) 
Clearing in excess of 45,000 square feet on any lot in a residence district is prohibited unless the following requirements are met: 

(a) 
The area of the lot, excluding the area of any flag strip but otherwise determined as set forth in § 255-1-20 hereof, exceeds 300,000 square feet; and 

(b) 
Site plan approval and a special permit have been first obtained from the Planning Board.

H. List of prohibited hazardous chemicals. The Natural Resources Director may compile, update and distribute an inventory of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides or other chemicals which he deems to be a serious threat to the health, safety or welfare of residents of the Town of East Hampton if introduced into the environment in the water recharge areas of the Town. After such inventory shall have been approved as an official Town inventory by formal Town Board resolution adopted after public hearing held on 10 days' notice in the official newspaper, the use or application in the overlay district of any such chemical included on such duly adopted or amended inventory shall thereafter be prohibited. 
§ 255-3-70. Harbor Protection Overlay District. [Added 10-6-1995 by L.L. No. 12-1995] 
§ 255-3-71. Purpose. [Added 10-6-1995 by L.L. No. 12-1995] 
The purpose of the Harbor Protection Overlay District is to maintain or improve surface water quality in East Hampton's major harbors, creeks and ponds, including Accabonac Creek, Fort Pond (including the arm of Fort Pond north of Industrial Road), Georgica Pond, Great Pond (Lake Montauk), Hog Creek, Napeague Harbor, Northwest Creek, Northwest Harbor, Steppingstones Pond, Three Mile Harbor, Tuthill Pond and Wainscott Pond. The district is also intended to maintain or improve wildlife habitat in these areas and to maintain or restore these waterways as closely as possible to their natural condition, so that the Town's citizens and visitors can continue to enjoy and appreciate their natural values. The Harbor Protection Overlay District will help prevent the entry of stormwater runoff into the Town's waters; gradually require the upgrading of out-moded or inoperable septic systems; preserve important indigenous vegetation; reduce impacts from residential and commercial swimming pools; and upgrade standards for fuel storage tanks. East Hampton's waterways are among the Town's most prized features. They support bountiful shellfish and finfish resources, offer prime habitat for local wildlife and offer residents and visitors a place to swim, fish, hunt, boat, observe wildlife and enjoy scenic beauty and tranquillity. The overlay district will help preserve these important benefits for future generations. 
§ 255-3-73. Boundaries. [Added 10-6-1995 by L.L. No. 12-1995] 
The boundaries of the Harbor Protection Overlay District shall be as shown on the Use District Map. The same may be amended from time to time by local law. 
§ 255-3-75. Regulations. [Added 10-6-1995 by L.L. No. 12-1995] 
In addition to any other provisions of this chapter which may apply to them, lots, lands, buildings, structures, uses and activities within the Harbor Protection Overlay District shall be subject to the following restrictions and regulations: 
A. Control of stormwater runoff. The following regulations shall apply to structures or activities which produce or contribute to stormwater pollution of the Town's surface waters: 
(1) 
No parking lot or private driveway shall hereafter be constructed unless it has either an unimproved surface (e.g., dirt, crushed shells) or an improved surface consisting of one or more of the following materials: poured concrete, hot plant mix asphalt, rapid-curing cut-back asphalt or quartz gravel. 

(2) 
No road, private driveway or parking lot with an improved surface shall hereafter be 


§ 255-3-75 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-75 
constructed unless all stormwater generated by said structure is directed into one or more catchment basins. Said catchment basin or basins shall have a combined volume (in cubic feet) equal to the surface area of the road, driveway and/or parking area (in square feet), divided by six. 
(3) 
Any road, private driveway or parking lot which is hereafter constructed with an improved surface shall be maintained so that all stormwater generated by said structure is actually directed into the catchment basin or basins required by the preceding subsection. Any catchment basin required by the preceding subsection shall be kept clean and maintained so that it recharges stormwater into the ground without overflowing. 

(4) 
No pipe, culvert, drain or similar conduit may hereafter be constructed or installed which discharges stormwater into wetlands (including surface waters). 

(5) 
Every principal building or addition to a principal building which is hereafter constructed or erected shall be furnished with gutters and leaders to direct stormwater from roofs into one or more catchment basins. Said catchment basin or basins shall have a combined volume (in cubic feet) equal to the surface area of the roof (in square feet), divided by six.

B. Depth to groundwater: for projects involving the installation of septic system discharge devices or swimming pools, or which require the installation of catchment basins, the mean depth to groundwater in the areas proposed for any septic system, swimming pool or catchment basin. 
§ 255-3-80. Coastal Erosion Overlay District. [Added 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
§ 255-3-81. Purpose. [Added 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
The purpose of the Coastal Erosion Overlay District is the protection of the Town's natural shoreline and coastal resources. These features require protection because of their important flooding and erosion prevention functions, their scenic qualities, their value for public recreation and water access, and their value as wildlife habitat. The overlay district is divided into four coastal erosion zones, each of which covers sections of the Town's coast which have similar features, characteristics, and storm exposures. The district establishes rules and standards for erosion control structures and projects, which may differ from one zone to the next. 
§ 255-3-82. Boundaries. [Added 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
The Coastal Erosion Overlay District shall encompass all lands, including underwater lands, which are located within any of the following areas: (i) landward of the mean high water line of any tidal waters within the Town, to a line which is 200 feet landward of said mean high water line, (ii) seaward of said mean high water line, to a line which is 1,000 feet seaward of the mean low water line of any tidal waters within the Town, or (iii) seaward of the mean high water line, to the contour line at which mean low water depth is 15 feet. The overlay district shall consist of four coastal erosion zones as shown on the Use District map. The coastal erosion zones constituting the Coastal Erosion Overlay District shall be identified as follows: 
A. Coastal Erosion Overlay Zone 1: Ocean coastal zone, including bluffs, dunes, beaches, and nearshore areas. This zone is predominantly free of erosion control structures. 
B. Coastal Erosion Overlay Zone 2: Bay coastal zone, including bluffs, dunes, beaches, and nearshore areas, which is predominantly free of erosion control structures. 
§ 255-3-82 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-3-85 
C. Coastal Erosion Overlay Zone 3: Bay coastal zone, including bluffs, dunes, beaches, and nearshore areas, which contains erosion control structures which are isolated and discontinuous, or which have no substantial flooding or erosion protection function. 
D. Coastal Erosion Overlay Zone 4: Bay coastal zone, including any remaining bluffs, dunes, beaches, and nearshore areas, which contains numerous erosion control structures. Within this zone the loss of natural resources and features such as bluffs, dunes, and beaches means that in many cases erosion control structures provide the only remaining protection against flooding and erosion. 
§ 255-3-85. Regulations. [Added 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007]

§ 255-4-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 255-4-15 
ARTICLE IV 
Protection of Natural Resources 
§ 255-4-10. Purpose of article. [Amended 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
The regulations in this article are adopted to protect and perpetuate some of the Town's most important natural resources. Rapid growth and development have encroached upon or despoiled many of the Town's wetlands, watercourses, tidal waters, natural drainage areas, watersheds and water recharge areas, as well as its beaches, dunes, bluffs, and other coastal features. These natural resources, which are threatened by the Town's growth, constitute important physical, social, scenic, aesthetic, recreational, and economic attributes of the Town. The provisions of this article are therefore designed to preserve and maintain these natural resources by minimizing their disturbance. Such protection will benefit the Town and its people in many ways, among which are the following: 
A. The protection of wetlands, watercourses, tidal waters, and marine habitat from damage caused by pollution, turbidity, siltation, or direct destruction, thereby protecting stocks of fish, shellfish, and other marine organisms, as well as the wildlife and vegetation which depend upon these resources for their survival. 
B. The protection of the Town's underground water supply and the quality of its tidal and fresh waters, through the preservation of natural filtration areas, natural vegetative buffers, and recharge sites. 
C. The lessening of danger to life and property caused by coastal flooding and storms. 
D. The preservation of beaches and other coastal habitat needed to sustain rare or threatened coastal birds, as well as fragile coastal vegetative communities. 
E. The preservation of the Town's beaches, dunes, bluffs, wetlands, marshes, and other coastal resources, which together are integral to the character of East Hampton and to its social and economic well-being. 
§ 255-4-12. Natural resources. [Amended 7-2-1993 by L.L. No. 18-1993; 11-15-1996 by 
L.L. No. 19-1996; 12-18-1997 by L.L. No. 38-1997; 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
The following are hereby designated as natural resources which are in need of special protection as provided in this article: 
A. Tidal and freshwater wetlands. All tidal and freshwater wetlands as defined in this chapter, including all wetlands shown or identified as such on the Freshwater Wetlands Map for Suffolk County, promulgated by the Department of Environmental Conservation pursuant to the Freshwater Wetlands Act (Article 24 of the New York Environmental Conservation Law). 
B. Tidal waters and watercourses, and nearshore areas, as defined in this chapter. 
C. Beaches, dunes, bluffs, and the vegetation which grows thereon, all as defined in this chapter. 
§ 255-4-15. Legislative findings regarding the functions and benefits of natural resources. [Added 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
The Town Board finds that the natural resources regulated under this article have important benefits for the Town and its people. Among these benefits, many of which have been expressly recognized by the New York State Legislature in the Environmental Conservation Law, are those set forth below. 
A. Tidal wetlands, generally. Tidal wetlands constitute one of the most vital and productive components of the natural world. The many and multiple values of such wetlands include the following: 
(1) 
Marine food production. Tidal wetlands are a nursery and sanctuary for many species of crustaceans, shellfish, and finfish. These wetlands produce nutrients and sustain macro-and microscopic marine organisms and vegetation which are essential to the terrestrial and marine food chains. Two-thirds of the commercially harvested fish and shellfish and 2/3 of sport fish depend on the marsh-estuarine system of the tidal wetlands at some point in their life cycle. 

(2) 
Wildlife habitat. Tidal wetlands are the breeding, nesting, and feeding grounds for many forms of waterfowl, shorebirds, and other wildlife, and are needed by many species as cover from predators. 

(3) 
Flood and storm control. Tidal wetlands provide valuable protection from coastal storms and floods. Their hydrologic water absorption and storage capacity minimize erosion and flood damage; their hydraulic and hydrographic functions serve as a natural buffer protecting upland and developed areas from storm tides and waves. 

(4) 
Recreation. Tidal wetlands directly or indirectly provide thousands of opportunities per year for the pursuit of hunting, fishing, boating, hiking, bird watching, photography, and recreational activities, to the enjoyment of many East Hampton residents and visitors and to the benefit of the Town's economy. 

(5) 
Pollution control. Tidal wetlands serve as an invaluable and irreplaceable biological and chemical oxidation basin in which organic run-off and organic pollution are oxidized, metabolized, and converted into useful nutrients. The vast quantities of oxygen necessary for these processes derive from the photosynthetic mechanism of tidal wetlands. 

(6) 
Sedimentation control. Tidal wetlands are an essential settling and filtering basin for the absorption of silt and organic matter which would otherwise obstruct channels and harbors to the detriment of navigation. 

(7) 
Education and research. Tidal wetlands afford a wide range of opportunities for scientific research, outdoor biophysical laboratory work, and living educational classroom programs, having great training and education value for Town residents and visitors of all ages. 

(8) 
Open space and aesthetic appreciation. Tidal wetlands comprise a large part of the remaining natural and unspoiled areas along the Town's coastline. The public benefit of these natural open areas in a growing, changing Town is significant. Tidal wetlands offer unique open space and aesthetic qualities while sustaining their other natural 


§ 255-4-15 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-4-15 
values. 
B. Benefits of specific types of tidal wetlands. Tidal wetlands consist of several ecological zones, including high marsh or salt meadow; coastal fresh marsh; intertidal marsh; the littoral area; coastal shoals, bars, and flats; and nearshore areas. In addition, the upland areas adjoining tidal wetlands serve to protect the wetlands and contribute in important ways to their productivity. The functions and benefits of certain types of tidal wetlands include the following: 
(1) 
High marsh or salt meadow tidal wetlands. High marsh or salt meadow constitutes an extensive zone of salt marshes which receive only occasional tidal flooding coincident with extreme lunar tides and occasional storms. Since their photosynthetic productivity is lower than intertidal marshes and coastal fresh marshes and since flushing of the biological products of the high marsh or salt meadow to the estuary is less efficient than in intertidal and coastal fresh marshes, salt meadows or high marshes, while vital to marine food production, they are slightly less important in this regard than intertidal or coastal fresh marshes. Because of their size and location, however, salt meadows or high marshes are as important for the absorption of silt and organic material and for flood, hurricane, and storm control as intertidal marshes and coastal fresh marshes. Furthermore, because they are generally located as to first receive run-off and other materials from the upland, they have an important role in cleansing ecosystems, although their value in this respect is generally slightly less than in intertidal and coastal fresh marshes because of the lessened tidal influence in high marshes or salt meadows. Because these wetlands are usually located adjacent to intertidal marshes and because their values are similar, salt meadows or high marshes must be stringently protected. Even small portions of these areas are very important resources, although slightly less so than intertidal marshes and coastal fresh marshes. 

(2) 
Intertidal marsh and coastal fresh marsh tidal wetlands. Intertidal and coastal fresh marsh wetlands are the most biologically productive of all tidal wetlands areas. Furthermore, since they receive twice-daily tidal flushing, the products of vegetative photosynthetic activity and decomposition in these zones are readily transported to adjacent waters for use in the estuarine food chain. Their intertidal location makes them among the most effective wetland zones for flood, hurricane, and storm protection. Both their intertidal location and their highly productive nature makes these wetlands among the most effective wetland zones for cleansing ecosystems and for absorbing silt and organic material. Because of these high values and their sensitive location at the land and water interface, intertidal and coastal fresh marshes must be stringently protected. Even small portions of these zones are critically important natural resources. 

(3) 
Nearshore areas and the littoral zone. Nearshore and littoral areas are the habitat of hard and soft clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops, as well as many other types of marine organisms. The shellfish help to support the still significant portion of the Town's population which makes its living from the sea, and also support a recreational shellfishery. Baitfish and other marine species living in these areas are crucial links in the maritime food chain. Along the bay and ocean coastlines of the Town, nearshore bottomland areas play an important role in controlling the erosion of the Town's coastline. Shallow nearshore areas cause waves to collapse or break, thus dissipating wave energy before it is expended on beaches, bluffs, or dunes. They also function as reservoirs of sand and gravel which can be returned to the beaches. 


Sandbars, which are located in nearshore areas, control the orientation of incoming waves and limit their power, thereby also helping to protect shorelines during storms. The roots of aquatic vegetation in nearshore areas bind fine-grained silts, clays, and organic matter to form a cohesive bottom that resists erosion. This vegetation also assists in trapping sediments. 
C. Benefits of freshwater wetlands. Freshwater wetlands are highly productive natural areas which are necessary to the survival of many species of fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. The numerous and varied values of such wetlands include the following: 
(1) 
Freshwater fisheries. In areas with open water, freshwater wetlands are the spawning and nursery grounds for a number of fish species within the Town, several of which are harvested by recreational fishermen. These include yellow perch, smallmouth and largemouth bass, and pickerel. Freshwater wetlands provide the nutrients needed to sustain the aquatic food chain, while purifying stormwater runoff into open waters and helping to regulate the amounts of dissolved oxygen and nitrogen in these waters. 

(2) 
Wildlife and plant habitat. Freshwater wetlands have unparalleled value as wildlife habitat. Most local species of wildlife depend upon their existence to at least some degree. In addition, many species of birds found in the Town at certain times of year are migratory and require freshwater wetlands for nesting or wintering purposes. Freshwater wetlands are also the habitat of numerous species of plants, shrubs, and trees, many of which are specifically adapted to the saturated soil conditions of these wetlands. The eastern end of Long Island, including East Hampton, has an unusually high percentage of the state's rare and threatened plant species; many of these species survive only in freshwater wetlands. 

(3) 
Flood and stormwater control. Freshwater wetlands slow the runoff of stormwaters and temporarily store these waters, thus helping to protect adjacent upland areas from flooding. 

(4) 
Recreation. Freshwater wetlands offer important opportunities for hunting, fishing, boating, hiking, bird watching, photography, and other recreational activities, to the enjoyment of many East Hampton residents and visitors and to the benefit of the Town's economy. In addition, freshwater wetlands contribute to these recreational pursuits well beyond their immediate boundaries, because of their ability to sustain populations of birds and wildlife. 

(5) 
Water supply and water quality. Freshwater wetlands are themselves a source of surface water and, under appropriate hydrological conditions, serve to recharge the Town's groundwater supplies and to maintain surface water flow. Freshwater wetlands also serve as chemical and biological oxidation basins that help to cleanse the water that flows through them. The wetlands absorb silt and organic matter, thereby preventing sedimentation of ponds and other open waters and preserving water quality. 

(6) 
Education and research. Because of their high biological productivity and the variety of plant and animal species that they support, freshwater wetlands benefit the Town's residents and visitors by providing outdoor laboratories and living classrooms for studying and appreciating natural history, ecology, and biology. 

(7) 
Open space and aesthetic appreciation. Freshwater wetlands afford visual variety in 


§ 255-4-15 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-4-15 
many different settings. Freshwater wetlands contribute to the Town's sense of open space and provide a sense of connection with the natural world. These are important elements of the Town's character which underpin its success and survival as both a year-round and resort community. 
D. Benefits of beaches. East Hampton's coastal area is characterized by beaches, dunes, and bluffs. These landforms, and the vegetation growing on them, are among the most important natural resources of the Town. The scenic beauty of the Town's beaches, as well as the dunes and bluffs which lie behind them, is a signature of the Town. The value of these features in protecting the Town's coastlands cannot be overstated. Beaches themselves have several important functions, among which are the following: 
(1) 
Flooding and erosion control. Beaches protect shorelands from flooding and erosion by dissipating wave energy that would otherwise be expended against the toe or face of bluffs and dunes, or which would send stormwaters spilling onto upland property. Beaches which are high and wide protect shorelands from erosion and flooding more effectively than beaches that are low or narrow. Beaches also act as a reservoir of sand and other unconsolidated material for littoral transport along the shore and for the formation of protective offshore sandbars and shoals. 

(2) 
Wildlife habitat. Beaches have habitat value, particularly for such shorebirds as the endangered piping plover and least tern. A variety of migratory and resident shorebirds, including piping plover and least tern, are directly dependent on beach habitat for their continued survival. 

(3) 
Recreation. Beaches are perhaps the single most important economic asset of the Town. They attract tourists and second home owners to the Town for a myriad of reasons. If East Hampton's beaches were to become significantly damaged or depleted, and their attraction for visitors thereby reduced, the economic impacts on the Town could well be incalculable. 


E. Benefits of bluffs. Bluffs are a natural and scenic asset of the Town. Their many important functions include the following: 
(1) 
Flooding and erosion control. Bluffs protect shorelands and coastal development by absorbing the wave energy associated with open water. Bluffs are also an important source of depositional material for beaches and for offshore sandbars and shoals. Through their own gradual erosion, bluffs provide material to maintain these other coastal features and thus to limit erosion on other sections of the coastline. 

(2) 
Wildlife habitat. Bluffs provide habitat for certain types of birds. This is particularly true on the ocean side of Montauk, where high, steep bluffs of clay and glacial till afford nesting areas for bank swallows. 

(3) 
Scenic vistas. Bluffs provide a natural barrier to development behind them and help preserve the natural scenic vista from the shoreline and surface waters. 


F. Benefits of dunes. Dunes are a significant part of East Hampton's coastal aesthetic. They also play an important role in protecting upland areas from storm damage and flooding and, for this reason, were among the first natural features in the Town to be protected by municipal regulation. Among the important functions of dunes are the following: 
(1) 
Flooding and erosion control. Like beaches and bluffs, dunes are of the greatest protective value during conditions of storm-induced high water. Because dunes often protect some of the Town's most biologically productive areas as well as developed coastal areas, their value as protective features is especially great. The two primary protective functions of dunes are prevention of wave overtopping and the storage of sand for coastal processes. High, vegetated dunes are more stable and thus provide a greater degree of protection than low, unvegetated ones. The keys to maintaining a stable dune system are the establishment and maintenance of beach vegetation and the assurance of a dependable supply of sand to nourish the dunes. 

(2) 
(Reserved) 


G. Benefits of beach vegetation. Beach and dune vegetation, such as beach grass but including other types of vegetation indigenous to the coastal zone, traps sand and organic matter and holds it in place, thereby helping dunes and bluffs to retain their cohesiveness against the erosive forces of wind and waves. By trapping sand and other material, beach vegetation allows dunes to increase in size and slows the rate of bluff erosion. Beach vegetation is therefore vital in protecting coastal areas from the effects of storms.

(1) 
Find that the proposed action constitutes a permissible emergency activity as described in this section. 

(2) 
Determine that the proposed emergency activity can and will be carried out in a manner which will cause the least adverse impact on the public health, safety, or welfare and the least harm to natural resources, features, and systems. 

(3) 
Where applicable, coordinate with and consider the comments of the Town Trustees or their authorized representatives. 

(4) 
Determine that (i) the building or structure in question is in imminent peril of incurring major structural damage as a result of flooding or erosion, and the proposed emergency activity is necessary to prevent such damage, or (ii) the building or structure has already incurred major structural damage because of flooding or erosion, and the proposed emergency activity is necessary to repair such damage or to prevent a structural failure of all or part of the building or structure. In making this determination, the Building Inspector may consult the Town Engineer or the Town Fire Marshal and may require the applicant to provide an evaluation and/or certification from a licensed professional engineer. 


C. Determination of Building Inspector. The Building Inspector shall, in writing, authorize or refuse to authorize a proposed emergency activity within five business days of his receipt of the notification (including all required information) described in Subsection A hereof.

§ 255-4-70. Shoreline fencing. [Added 12-18-2009 by L.L. No. 27-2009; amended 12-5-2013 by L.L. No. 12-2013] 
§ 255-4-70.1. Purpose. 
The Town of East Hampton and the Trustees of the Freeholders and Commonality of the Town of East Hampton (hereafter also known as the "permitting authority or authorities") recognize the potential benefits to beach renourishment by way of properly installed snow/sand or "shoreline fencing" upon our beaches. As a result, the Town hereby adopts standards for the installation of such fencing in order to allow oceanfront property owners to install such sand fencing upon or adjacent to their property for purposes of beach replenishment. Fences installed in strict compliance with the provisions of this section shall be exempt from the requirements of Chapter 255, Zoning, §§ 255-3-85 (Coastal Erosion Overlay District: Regulations); 255-4-40 (Coastal setbacks, including bluff and dune crest setbacks); and 255-5-50 (Natural resources special permit) of the Town Code of the Town of East Hampton.

(1) 
Shoreline fencing may be installed only for the purpose of building sand dunes by trapping windblown sand, the protection of the dune(s) and protection of existing or planted vegetation and for no other purpose. 

(2) 
A shoreline fencing permit requires a fee of $75, to be paid to the Parks Department or Town Trustees, depending upon the jurisdictional area the fence is located in. 

(a) 
Permits expire one year from date of issue. Subsequent restoration projects require a new application and permit. 

(b) 
Planting of beach grass or other revegetation shall require a separate permit.

(b) 
Fencing shall be supported by untreated wooden posts of not less than two inches by three inches in dimension, and at least six feet in length, unless other materials are approved by the permitting authority which posts shall be driven into the sand so that the top of the posts are no higher than the top of the fencing. Such posts shall be spaced no more than every 10 feet of fence length. In the event that materials other than wood are approved for posts, each such post shall be tagged with a unique identification number. 

(c) 
Fencing shall be secured to the posts by no less than two heavy-duty (at least 150 pounds tensile strength), UV-resistant plastic zip ties. 

(d) 
At least one section of sand fencing shall display the permit number issued by the Natural Resources Department or the Town Trustees after inspection and approval of the fence installation by Natural Resources or the Town Trustees. 


(4) 
Shoreline fencing shall be installed in a zig-zag pattern as follows (see illustration, end of this chapter) unless otherwise approved by the Parks Department, Natural Resources Department, and Town Trustees and noted on the permit: 

(a) 
A single row of shoreline fencing shall be installed at the toe of the most seaward dune, but in no event shall such fencing extend more than 10 feet seaward of either existing dune vegetation or the toe of such seaward dune, whichever is further seaward; 

(b) 
Shoreline fencing shall be installed at an angle of at least 45º to the shoreline unless and until an alternative design is proven more effective or unless an alternate design has been approved by the permitting authority; 

(c) 
Individual sections of fence shall be no longer than 10 feet in length and shall be spaced no less than seven feet apart from one another (see diagram); 

(d) 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, fencing shall not interfere with wildlife nesting areas, recreational or emergency vehicular access or in a manner that impedes or restricts established common law and statutory rights of public access and use of public trust lands and waters. 



(5) 
Maintenance of shoreline fencing. During the period in which such sand fencing is installed, it shall be maintained as follows: 

(a) 
Broken or missing slats and/or posts shall be replaced and broken wires secured to avoid injury to passersby; 

(b) 
All previously installed fencing, especially that exposed due to storm/weather event, whether still intact or debris upon the beach, will be removed at the expense of the applicant prior to granting of a permit for installation of any new fence, unless the permitting agency determines that such installed fencing or part thereof is in acceptable condition and is installed in a manner consistent with the provisions of this law, in which case such fence or part thereof deemed acceptable may be incorporated into the new application. 




§ 255-4-70.2 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-4-95

If the Building Inspector, in administering or enforcing any provision of this chapter, is in doubt as to the existence, location, boundary or extent of any natural feature, resource or system, including but not limited to those designated in § 255-4-12 hereof, he shall consult with the Natural Resources Director and/or Planning Director, who shall provide the Building Inspector with a written determination regarding the same. Where the Natural Resources Director or Planning Director informs the Building Inspector in writing as to the existence, location, boundary or extent of any such natural feature, resource or system, either in response to the Building Inspector's inquiry or without such an inquiry, this determination shall be binding upon the Building Inspector and the affected property owner for all purposes under this chapter, unless and until a different determination shall have been rendered by the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to the authority given it in Article VIII hereof. 
§ 255-4-85. Subdivision of land.210 [Amended 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007]

This section shall not be construed to prevent the Planning Board from requiring setbacks of whatever greater size it deems reasonable and necessary in a particular subdivision application. 
§ 255-4-90. (Reserved) 
§ 255-4-95. Exempted activities. [Amended 4-21-1989 by L.L. No. 2-1989; 12-18-1997 by L.L. No. 38-1997]

§ 255-5-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 255-5-26 
ARTICLE V 
Special Permit Uses 
§ 255-5-10. Purpose. 
The provisions of this article are designed to provide for administrative review of selected types of proposed land uses. Certain uses which are allowable under zoning are nevertheless so likely to significantly affect their surroundings that they require individual review to assure compatibility with existing land use patterns, community character and the natural environment before being permitted to come into existence. Similarly, certain authorized uses may take on such diverse forms in their actual implementation that it is wise to review and pass upon the adherence of each individual proposal to standards and guidelines previously established for the use involved. Finally, the case-by-case review achieved by use of the special permit mechanism can increase the flexibility and appropriateness of local development review and better enable local officials to avoid negative consequences which sometimes arise from the otherwise lawful development or use of a particular site. 
§ 255-5-20. Special permit uses. [Amended 12-18-1997 by L.L. No. 38-1997; 2-10-1998 by L.L. No. 6-1998] 
There is hereby created a category of land uses to be known as "special permit uses." Said uses may not be commenced, created, undertaken, carried out or thereafter maintained or substantially expanded without a special permit first having been obtained therefor, which special permit shall have been granted for the use by the board responsible for its administration, according to the provisions for the particular special permit set forth in this article. Any land use, including the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, demolition, moving, conversion or change of use of any structure, shall be a special permit use requiring a special permit if the text of this chapter or the Use Table, § 255-11-10 hereof, denotes the use or activity as being either the subject of a special permit or simply a special permit use. No building permit for any such special permit use shall be issued until the required special permit shall have been granted for the same, and the conditions imposed in such permit as prerequisites to a building permit, if there are any, have been met. 
§ 255-5-25. Status of existing special permit uses. [Amended 8-16-1985 by L.L. No. 8-1985] 
Special permit uses which either lawfully exist on the effective date of this article or which subsequently come into being pursuant to the provisions hereof shall, in all respects, constitute lawful and conforming uses under this chapter. With the exception of the requirement in § 255-5-26 hereof, no such use shall again require the issuance of a special permit in order to be maintained, operated, continued, enlarged or altered, and building permits may be issued therefor, subject only to provisions of this chapter applicable to any such use in any such district. The preceding sentence shall not, however, be construed to apply to natural resources special permits required pursuant to Article IV of this chapter. 
§ 255-5-26. Substantial expansion of existing special permit uses. [Amended 12-18-1997 by L.L. No. 40-1997] 
Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in the preceding section, an existing special permit use as described therein shall require a special permit in any case where a substantial expansion of such use is undertaken. In such case, the local agency having jurisdiction over the special permit needed for the expansion shall review and decide upon the application for such permit pursuant to the same substantive and procedural standards as are provided for herein for an original special permit. Any special permit issued to authorize a substantial expansion of an existing special permit use shall be conditioned upon conformance by the use to any standards (other than standards concerning initial site location) of §§ 255-5-40, 255-4-45 and 255-5-50 of this article with which it does not then comply. 
§ 255-5-30. Special permits. 
§ 255-5-31. Applications. [Amended 6-20-2019 by L.L. No. 28-2019] 
An application for a special permit shall be on the form for same provided by the Building Inspector and shall be submitted in triplicate, together with the appropriate fee, to the Building Inspector, who shall review the application for completeness and conformity with this chapter. The Building Inspector shall reject the application if it is not complete or not in conformance and shall notify the applicant as to the reason for such rejection. If the application is satisfactory, the applicant, the Building Inspector and the board to which the application is forwarded shall then follow the procedures in Article IX hereof regarding the processing of applications by boards. Any application for a special permit may be accompanied by one or more applications for other local agency permissions or approvals which this chapter requires for the activity or use for which the special permit is being sought. The property owner or his or her agent shall provide, and the reviewing department confirm, the existence of any applicable scenic, conservation and agricultural easement, or purchase of development rights agreements as to which the Town of East Hampton, a conservation organization or a homeowners' association is a grantee or party, in, upon or adjacent to the premises, protecting any designated natural feature, or burdening or benefiting the subject property. 
§ 255-5-32. Effect of permit. 
A special permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall authorize only the special permit use for which the permit is granted. No use which is not a special permit use hereunder shall be authorized by any such permit. The permit may include any number of reasonable conditions which the issuing local agency determines to be necessary or appropriate to ensure that the applicable general and specific standards and safeguards set forth in this article for the use can and will be met and/or adhered to. Unless a different period is specified herein, a special permit shall be valid for a period of six months, but may be extended for one additional six-month period by the issuing agency without the requirement of new public notice or hearing. A continuing or permanent land use authorized by a special permit which use is undertaken or begun during the period of validity of such permit shall thereafter be deemed a lawful use, as if the same were permitted by this chapter without need for a special permit; provided, however, that: 
A. All conditions imposed by the special permit, unless by their express terms of limited duration, shall continue to apply; 
B. All conditions imposed on special permit uses generally or specifically by this chapter shall continue to apply, regardless of whether any such conditions were expressly incorporated into the special permit issued; and 
C. The board which issued the special permit shall retain continuing jurisdiction over the same as provided for in § 255-9-25. 
§ 255-5-32 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-5-38 
D. The requirements of § 255-5-25 concerning substantial expansion shall apply. 
§ 255-5-35. Administration of special permits. 
Except in cases where the responsibility for issuance of a particular special permit is given to another local agency by the explicit provisions of § 255-5-50 hereof, the Planning Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all special permits created in this chapter and shall have the sole and complete responsibility for the issuance of same in conformity with all applicable regulations herein.211 
§ 255-5-38. Pilot program: transfer of indoor dining use to outdoor space special permit. [Added 4-1-2021 by L.L. No. 9-2021] 
A. Intent. The Town Board desires to determine whether there is a means to create flexibility in the manner that restaurants operate at different times of the year, under various weather conditions, and/or in reaction to emergency circumstances such as brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. This pilot program is not intended to replace or circumvent the Planning Board or site plan requirements in general, but only to allow for adjustments in the placement of dining use on the approved property. The Town Board is considering this program be implemented as a special permit process so that compliance with the conditions thereof can be more easily enforced and the potential negative impact on the neighborhood, and Town as a whole, can be minimized. 
B. Authorization for outdoor dining. The utilization of outdoor space, for a previously approved indoor dining use, may only be permitted if authorized: 
(1) 
Pursuant to Article VI of Chapter 255, "Site Plan Review"; 

(2) 
Pursuant to this section, "Transfer of Indoor Use Dining to Outdoor Space Special Permit"; 

(3) 
Pursuant to Chapter 151, "Special Event Permits"; or 

(4) 
Pursuant to § 255-11-88, "Outdoor Dining at Restaurants." 


C. Limitation of use to dining. Only restaurant dining use, limited to the service of food and beverages to seated patrons, may be transferred to outdoor spaces pursuant to this section. 
(1) 
No outdoor food preparation is permitted in the outdoor space. 

(2) 
No bar use is permitted in the outdoor space. 

(3) 
No new use may be introduced into the previously utilized indoor space without site plan approval, although vacated space may be used to facilitate take-out food service so long as no service of alcohol is provided to those waiting on food orders. 

(4) 
No approved features or conditions of an approved site plan may be removed or altered to create new outdoor space. Only additions that are not in conflict with the approved site plan, and that are necessary to effectuate the utilization of outdoor space in compliance with the conditions of this section (screening, delineation for the

service of alcoholic beverages, but not tents), may be made without additional site plan approval, and all necessary building permits must be obtained. 
D. Occupancy that may be transferred. 
(1) 
The transfer of restaurant dining use from indoors to an outdoor space pursuant to this section may be seasonal or weather related, so long as approvable seating plans are submitted for each possible circumstance. 

(2) 
The combined occupancy of patrons, indoor and outdoor, may not exceed 100% of the approved indoor seating (number of seats) capacity without additional site plan approval. Approved indoor seating capacity is determined by site plan or, if no site plan exists, the seating capacity, for indoor dining, and not bar use, as determined by the Fire Marshal. 

(3) 
In the following zoning districts the maximum percentage of capacity that may be transferred from indoors to outdoors is 100%: Central Business, Waterfront, Recreational Overlay, Resort, Commercial Industrial and Commercial Service. In all other zoning districts the maximum percentage of capacity that may be transferred from indoor to outdoors is 75% (Neighborhood Business, Residential and Limited Business Overlay). 

(4) 
Notwithstanding the above, for restaurants that are preexisting nonconforming in a residential district, the occupancy of dining transferred to an outside location cannot be such to violate the provisions of either § 255-1-40, Nonconforming uses, or § 255-1-42, Nonconforming buildings and structures. 


E. Location of outdoor dining space. Approvable seating plan(s) must be submitted with the application. 
(1) 
The outdoor dining space must be on the same property that has the approved restaurant indoor dining use. 

(2) 
Such outdoor space shall be set back from any side or rear yard property line, when the adjoining property is a residence, a distance which is twice that required by the provisions of § 255-11-10 for an accessory building or structure on the subject lot, and such outdoor space must be located more than 100 feet from a structure used for residential purposes (including, but not limited to, the house, pool, decking, and patio). 

(3) 
Such space must be configured such that the noise and other effects generated will be reasonably screened from adjacent properties and compatible with existing and potential uses thereon. Where such an adjacent property is a residential property or any property with an occupied residence, complete screening of the activity and its effects shall be deemed necessary to meet this requirement. 

(4) 
If the outdoor space is to be used for the service of alcoholic beverages, it must be delineated from all other outdoor space such that the consumption of such beverages is limited to within that space, and the occupancy limitation of such space shall be the same as indoor dining (at a ratio of 15 square feet per person), and the occupancy limit shall be clearly posted. No point of sale or service bar may be placed in the outdoor space without site plan approval. 


§ 255-5-38 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-5-38

A special permit for a transfer of indoor use to outdoor space special permit shall only be issued by the Building Inspector upon the following findings: 
(1) 
The proposed outdoor space for the site is clearly depicted on a survey or similar rendering such that the space is clearly identified on the property; 

(2) 
The proposed outdoor space is compliant with the provisions of this section; 

(3) 
There is adequate parking, existing and/or proposed, available for the outdoor dining use; 

(4) 
All submitted seating plans are consistent with approved occupancy limits, indicate required egress, and are clearly marked as to under what circumstances each plan will be utilized; and 

(5) 
Any building permits necessary to effectuate the use of the proposed outdoor space must be submitted. 


K. Revocation and suspension. 
(1) 
A special permit issued under this section may be revoked by the Building Inspector upon conviction for a Town Code violation based upon allegations of noncompliance with the conditions upon which the special permit was issued. No revocation will be the result of a noise violation conviction unless such conviction also resulted in the denial of a music entertainment permit. 

(2) 
The use of the outdoor space pursuant to this special permit may be suspended if the Building Inspector, Fire Marshal or Code Compliance Emergency Preparedness Coordinator has reasonable grounds to believe that the use of such outdoor space is not in compliance with the conditions upon which the special permit was issued and such noncompliance is creating an unsafe and dangerous situation. Such suspension shall be upon written notice as to the unsafe and dangerous situation, as well as conditions under which use may be resumed, being provided to the applicant's agent supervising the use of the restaurant. The suspension may be lifted upon the Building Inspector, Fire Marshal or Town Public Safety Director's satisfaction that the stated remedial conditions have been met and that dangerous noncompliance is not likely to reoccur. Any suspension of a special permit lasting for more than 24 hours must be accompanied by the issuance of an appearance ticket specifying the relevant violation of Town Code, or the suspension is automatically lifted. An appearance ticket may, but need not, be issued for a dangerous noncompliance that is immediately remedied.

M. Duration of pilot program. This pilot program shall expire unless extended or incorporated as a permanent special permit, on December 2021. Any special permits issued pursuant to this pilot program shall expire on December 2021 and shall not constitute "existing special permits" under § 255-5-25, and approval for continued use must be obtained pursuant to different sections of the Town Code. 
§ 255-5-40. General standards. 
No special permit shall be granted unless the issuing board shall specifically find and determine that: 
A. Nature of use. The use proposed will be in harmony with and promote the general purposes of this chapter as the same are set forth in § 255-1-11 hereof. 
B. Lot area. The lot area is sufficient, appropriate and adequate for the use, as well as reasonably anticipated operation and expansion thereof. 
C. Adjacent properties. The proposed use will not prevent the orderly and reasonable use of adjacent properties, particularly where they are in a different district. 
D. Compatibility. The site of the proposed use is a suitable one for the location of such a use in the Town, and, if sited at that location, the proposed use will in fact be compatible with its surroundings and with the character of the neighborhood and of the community in general, particularly with regard to visibility, scale and overall appearance. 
E. Effect on specific existing uses. The characteristics of the proposed use are not such that its proposed location would be unsuitably near to a church, school, theater recreational area or other place of public assembly. 
F. Use definition. The proposed use conforms to the Town Code definition of the special permit use where such definition exists or with the generally accepted definition of such use where no definition is included in the Code. 
G. Circulation. Access facilities are adequate for the estimated traffic generated by the proposed use on public streets and sidewalks, so as to assure the public safety and to avoid traffic congestion; and, further, that vehicular entrances and exits shall be clearly visible from the street and not within 75 feet of the intersection of street lines at a street intersection, except under unusual circumstances. 
H. Parking. There is room for creation of off-street parking and truck loading spaces at least in the number required by the applicable provisions of this chapter, but in any case adequate for the actual anticipated number of occupants of the proposed use, whether employees, patrons and visitors; and, further, that the layout of the spaces and related facilities can be made convenient and conducive to safe operation. 
I. Buffering and screening. Adequate buffer yards and screening can and will be provided to protect adjacent properties and land uses from possible detrimental impacts of the proposed use. 
J. Runoff and waste. Adequate provision can and will be made for the collection and disposal of stormwater runoff, sewage, refuse and other liquid, solid or gaseous waste which the proposed use will generate. 
K. Environmental protection. The natural characteristics of the site are such that the proposed use may be introduced there without undue disturbance or disruption of important natural features, systems or processes and without significant negative impact to groundwater and surface waters on and off the site. 
L. Compliance with other laws. The proposed use can and will comply with all provisions of this chapter and of the Code, including Chapters 180 and 185 thereof, which are applicable to it, and can meet every other applicable federal, state, county and local law, ordinance, rule or regulation. 
M. Conformity with other standards. The proposed use can and will meet all of the general standards for special permit uses in particular districts set forth in § 255-5-45 and also meets all of the specific standards and incorporates all of the specific safeguards required of the particular use, if any, by § 255-5-50. 
§ 255-5-45. General standards in particular districts. 
No special permit shall be granted in the use districts included in this section unless the issuing board shall specifically find and determine that, in addition to meeting all of the general standards for special permit uses contained in § 255-5-40, the proposed special permit use can and will meet the general standards set forth in this section for special permit uses in the particular district in which the use is proposed to be located. 
A. Limited Business Overlay District: 
(1) 
Existing residential buildings and structures shall be used to house the special permit use or activity if at all feasible or where required by this chapter. 

(2) 
Whether an existing structure is to be used, with or without expansion, or a new structure is to be erected, all buildings and structures on the lot shall conform to a residential architectural style similar in character to the residential neighborhood in which the use is to be established. Along with the Planning Board, the Architectural Review Board shall ensure compliance with this provision as part of its review pursuant to Articles VI and VII hereof, in order to assure a continuing residential appearance for the site. 

(3) 
Lot coverage and total lot coverage, building height, setbacks, and other related dimensional requirements of the underlying residence district shall apply, except that lesser setbacks for principal buildings and structures for semi-public facilities and lesser setbacks for accessory buildings and structures may be approved by the Planning Board pursuant to site plan review where it is specifically determined by the 


§ 255-5-45 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-5-45 
Board that such lesser setbacks will not have a detrimental effect on neighboring properties, particularly properties presently being put to residential use, where such lesser setbacks will serve the interests of good planning, and where no other provision of this chapter (e.g., specific requirements for a special permit use) restricts the Board's power to approve such lesser setbacks. In no event shall a setback for a principal structure be reduced where the reduction will reduce the setback of a commercial structure from adjoining residential development. [Amended 8-16-1985 by L.L. No. 8-1985; 7-2-1999 by L.L. No. 15-1999; 6-4-2004 by L.L. No. 14-2004] 
(4) 
All yard areas shall be planned so as to accommodate the planting and maintenance of lawns, shrubs, trees and the retention of existing significant vegetation in order to help screen the use and the parking areas therefor from adjacent properties and the street. 

(5) 
Required parking needs shall be provided for in an off-street location and made unobtrusive as possible. 


B. Park and Conservation District: 
(1) 
All buildings and structures in the Park and Conservation (PC) District shall be those customarily related to the use proposed, such as clubhouses, tennis courts, pools, rest rooms, administration and maintenance buildings and the like, shall be of the minimum practical size, and shall require site plan review and architectural and design review. [Amended 10-4-2002 by L.L. No. 32-2002] 

(2) 
Where the use is a semipublic facility, such as a museum or interpretive center (which may contain accessory uses such as a gift shop), the use shall be allowed only if it relates directly to the historic or natural character of the land on which it is situated and serves to educate the public about the same. [Amended 10-4-2002 by L.L. No. 32-2002] 

(3) 
Where the use is a municipal facility, such as a fire station, or is a public utility as defined herein, the use should be allowed only if the public safety or convenience will be served, placement of the use in the Park and Conservation District is the only feasible location for the use and there is no legal restriction on the land prohibiting such use. 


C. Resort District. All business-type special permit uses in the Resort District (RS), except for resorts and transient motels, shall be supportive of and compatible with the principal resort-type uses of the district and, as such, when proposed on a lot containing a resort or transient motel, must not prevent compliance with the maximum coverage and maximum total coverage permitted in the district for both itself and the principal use on the lot. [Amended 8-16-1985 by L.L. No. 8-1985] 
D. Waterfront District. All special permit uses in the Waterfront District (WF), other than ferry terminals, are deemed not to be water-related uses, and therefore every such use: 
(1) 
Must not adversely affect any existing waterfront use which is so water-related or any potential water-related uses to be made of the lot or of nearby waterfront which are indicated in the Town Comprehensive Plan; 

(2) 
Must be ancillary to a principal water-related use in that the special permit use would 


economically support the principal water-related use and would enhance the ability of the general public to gain visual or physical access to the waterfront; 
(3) 
Must not usurp any land surface area needed by the principal water-related use and must, together with all uses on the lot, be able to demonstrate an integrated and adequate circulation and parking plan; and 

(4) 
Must have a maritime character or theme. 

(5) 
As a condition to the following special permit uses in the Waterfront District, the site shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the proposed use with safeguards set forth in § 255-5-50 below, but in no case shall the site be smaller than 40,000 square feet per two uses: [Added 10-16-1987 by L.L. No. 16-1987] 

(a) 
Auditorium or meeting hall. 

(b) 
Fish processing facility.

§ 255-5-50. Specific standards and safeguards. [Amended 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996] 
No special permit shall be issued unless the issuing board shall specifically find and determine that, in addition to meeting all of the general standards for special permit uses contained in §§ 255-5-40 and 255-5-45 hereof, the particular proposed special permit use also can and will meet the specific standards and safeguards set forth in this section, if any. Where a specific requirement, restriction, regulation, standard or safeguard regarding the extent, nature, size, configuration or conduct (but not the location) of a particular use is set forth in this section as a requirement or standard which must be met for a special permit to issue, such requirement or standard shall also be deemed a supplemental use regulation applicable to all such existing special permit uses in the Town, wherever located and whenever and however lawfully established. Lawfully preexisting special permit uses which do not comply with any such regulation shall be deemed nonconforming as to the same, but nothing in this section shall require the discontinuance or modification of any such lawfully preexisting special permit use. 
AFFORDABLE ACCESSORY APARTMENTS ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS  [Amended 12-1-2016 by L.L. No. 49-2016]

All dwelling units shall comply with standards set forth in § 255-11-63; and 

(2) 
Site plan approval (Article VI) and architectural review approval (Article VII) shall be obtained before issuance of any building permit or certificate of occupancy, and no special 


§ 255-5-50 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-5-50 
permit shall be issued until a public hearing, which hearing may be combined with the hearing required for site plan review, shall have been held. 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  
(1) 
Site considerations. 

(a) 
The entire proposed site for the development shall be located in an Affordable Housing Overlay District. 

(b)

(c) 
If a multiple residence is involved in the development, all dimensional, area and coverage requirements of the Dimensional Table of § 255-11-10 for the Multiple-Family District (MF) shall be complied with. 

(d) 
The maximum number of dwelling units on a site shall be 60. 

(e) 
The maximum permitted densities shall be calculated at eight units per acre for apartments and four units per acre for single-family residences or unimproved lots. For the purposes of assuring compliance with this subsection, the Planning Board shall compute the area of the site using the same criteria which it employs to establish permissible densities on ordinary subdivisions which it processes. [Amended 3-17-2022 by L.L. No. 6-2022] 

(f) 
The site shall be of such shape, dimension, topography and location as will allow for appropriate and attractive development with proper setbacks, screening and a harmonious relationship with adjoining land uses and the natural physical terrain. All conditions of § 255-11-40 must be complied with, but nothing in Subsections C, D and E thereof shall be construed as preventing issuance of a special permit for at least one type of affordable housing development at every otherwise eligible Affordable Housing Overlay District site. 



(2) 
Housing types. 

(a) 
Housing opportunities in the form of apartments, single-family residences or unimproved lots may be provided, but discretion as to the type and amount of dwelling units or lots shall rest with the Planning Board, which shall in all cases consider community housing needs in the area, together with the character of the neighborhood in which the site is located, the environmental suitability of the site and the proposed design of the development in making its determination. Where multiple residences containing apartments are proposed, all applicable requirements and conditions of the subsection below entitled "Multiple Residence" shall be complied with. 

(b) 
All dwelling units or lots created shall be for the use of and available to moderate-income families. 



(3) 
Services. 


(a) The development shall be served by public water or an approved community water supply. The Planning Board may, but need not, waive this requirement only as to unimproved lots which, because of their location and size, are able to obtain Suffolk County Department of Health Services approval for use of individual wells thereon. 
(b) 
The method of sewage disposal shall be approved by the Suffolk County Department of Health Services and shall also be deemed adequate and appropriate by the Planning Board. 

(c) 
Stormwater drainage systems shall be designed so that the rate of runoff from the site during a one-hundred-year storm will not exceed that which would have occurred prior to its development. The calculation of such runoff rate and the design of the drainage system shall be subject to approval of the Town Engineer. 

(d) 
Proper access for fire-fighting equipment and personnel shall be provided.

Exterior antennas for individual dwelling units shall not be permitted. 


(4) 
Design. 

(a) 
Each apartment created shall have its own separate entrance/exit leading directly to the outside. The Planning Board may waive this requirement, but only where it has determined, based upon recommendation of the Town Fire Prevention Inspector, that the intent of this requirement to provide for occupant safety while at the same time avoiding creation of common hallway areas has been achieved through an alternative building design. 

(b) 
Each apartment created shall be provided with a private outdoor space in the form of a patio, terrace, garden, courtyard, deck or balcony, which space shall immediately adjoin and be directly accessible to the dwelling unit it serves. 

(c) 
There shall be at least one recreation area on the site, improved and maintained for the exclusive use of the residents of the development and their nonpaying guests. It shall contain at least 75 square feet of lot area per dwelling unit, and in no case less than 50 square feet per bedroom. The plan for the recreation area shall be approved by the Planning Board as to location, design and adequacy, taking into account the size of the development and the nature of the anticipated occupancy thereof. 

(d) 
All portions of the site not required to be devoted to one or more of the uses described above shall be designed and maintained as open space, either to be landscaped or preserved in its natural state, all in accordance with plans approved by the Planning Board. 

(e) 
Site plan approval (Article VI) and architectural review approval (Article VII) shall be obtained prior to issuance of any building permit. 



(5) 
Legal. 


§ 255-5-50 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-5-50 
(a) 
An affordable housing development may be owned by one or more individuals or corporations, but shall be presented as a single site and single development proposal at the time application for a special permit is made. Such joint or combined ownership shall be confirmed in a written agreement, in recordable form, acceptable to the Town Attorney and approved by the Planning Board. 

(b) 
The Planning Board shall require that the applicant and/or owner execute such agreements, contracts, easements, covenants, deed restrictions or other legal instruments running in favor of the Town as, upon recommendation of the Town Attorney, the Board may determine to be necessary to ensure that: 


[1] The particular housing types and uses approved are in fact created and maintained; 
[2] The prices of lots, residences or apartments sold or resold, or the rentals charged for the same, fall within previously agreed-upon minimum and maximum guidelines, and that leases provide for year-round rentals; 
[3] The units created, and the site itself, are properly constructed, maintained and used, and unapproved uses are excluded; 
[4] The persons or class of persons for whom the development was designed and approved do in fact continue to occupy the housing created on the site and benefit from the existence of the development for the lifetime thereof; 
[5] The requirements of any other local, state or federal agency involved in the financing of the development or otherwise directly involved in sponsoring the same are adhered to; 
[6] The health, safety and welfare of occupants of the approved development and of adjacent property owners and other Town residents are adequately protected; 
[7] Any other condition deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure the immediate and long-term safety or success of the development is met. 
ANIMAL HUSBANDRY[Amended 9-17-1993 by L.L. No. 28-1993]:  
(1) 
The parcel shall have a minimum lot area of five acres, inclusive of any lot area requirement for a single-family residence on the property. 

(2) 
The Planning Board shall in any case determine that sufficient lot area exists for the use, considering the number and type of animals proposed to be accommodated, so that pasturage areas will not be denuded of vegetation and so that visual blight, blowing dust, soil erosion and similar problems will be avoided. In making this determination, the Planning Board may take into account industry standards and practices for the particular type of animal husbandry regarding a desirable lot area per animal. 

(3) 
All parking areas, animal shelters, stables and permanent or temporary manure storage areas shall be set back from lot boundaries such that no undue disturbance or nuisance is caused to neighboring property owners from noise, dust or odors.

In any such case, the Board shall fix the maximum number and type(s) of office uses to be permitted in the building as well as the maximum number of persons to be permitted to work in the building. The Board may provide in its approval that no further special permit or site plan approval shall be required to commence or change particular uses (in the form of tenancies or other occupancies) in the approved office building, provided that every new office use thereafter introduced is of a preapproved type, the total number of uses and employees in the office building at no time exceeds the fixed limit, and all other conditions imposed at the time special permit approval of the office building are strictly adhered to. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any party from the requirement to obtain a building permit (and all associated permits, if any) when carrying out structural changes to the interior of a building. 
(b) 
In approving an office building in a planned industrial park pursuant to the preceding subsection, the Planning Board shall not permit a number of office uses on the lot or site in excess of that which would otherwise be permitted by the provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to § 255-2-45 hereof.

§ 255-5-51. Specific standards and safeguards for natural resources special permits. [Added 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
Because of their number and complexity, the specific standards and safeguards applicable to natural resources special permits under § 255-5-50 hereof are set forth in this section. These standards and safeguards shall apply to every natural resources special permit as though set forth in their entirety in § 255-5-50. 
A. Natural resources special permits, generally. This special permit shall be issued by the 
§ 255-5-51 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-5-51 
Board of Appeals, which agency shall have exclusive and complete jurisdiction over the administration of such permit in accordance with the provisions of this section. In reviewing any application for a natural resources special permit, the Board of Appeals may refer the matter to the Planning Department and the Town Trustees (where applicable) for a recommendation. In the event of any such referral, the Planning Department and the Town Trustees (where applicable) shall make a recommendation in writing to the Board of Appeals within 30 days of the date of the referral. However, in the event that additional information is required by the Planning Department to complete its review, it shall notify the applicant within 10 days of the date of the referral what additional information is needed and, in such event, the Planning Department shall submit its recommendation to the Board of Appeals within 20 days after receipt of the requested information from the applicant. 
B. Delegation of natural resources special permits. Pursuant to the provisions of § 255-8-84 hereof, which authorize the Planning Department to process and issue certain natural resources special permits, the Board of Appeals may delegate such review and approval of individual applications to the Planning Department in any manner which the Board deems best suited to this purpose. With regard to any permit, class of permits, or permit application for which such a delegation has been duly made, references in this chapter to the Board of Appeals shall be construed, where appropriate, to mean the Planning Department. 
C. Compatibility with purposes of chapter. The building, structure, use, or activity for which a natural resources special permit is sought must be found to be compatible with the purposes set forth in § 255-1-11 and § 255-4-10 of this chapter. 
D. Preservation of natural resources. All structures and uses, other than coastal structures, shall be located on upland and shall be located so that no natural resource, feature, or system designated in § 255-4-12 hereof will be diminished in size, polluted, degraded, or lost, or placed in peril thereof, in order to establish such structure or use. If there is inadequate upland for the structure or use proposed, minimal exceptions to the requirements of this section may be authorized in the permit, but only after: 
(1) 
Alternative reasonable uses of the property are determined not to exist; and 

(2) 
Alternative designs entailing smaller buildings or structures, reduced yard or other setbacks, or diminished or reconfigured areas of use are determined not to be effective in preventing loss of or potential damage to designated natural features, or the only such designs are found to be infeasible or unlawful. 


E. Coastal structures, generally. A coastal structure may be placed at any location on a lot if the structure and the uses associated therewith are found not to be detrimental to any natural resource, feature, or system designated in § 255-4-12 hereof. No permit shall issue for any structure which would unduly interfere with tidal flow or marine life or habitat, or which would destroy other than the minimal practicable areas of beach vegetation, wetland vegetation, or eel grass (Zostera marina). For the purposes of this section, a structure will be deemed in violation of the preceding sentence and ineligible for a natural resources special permit if the structure, together with all similar structures likely to be sited in the vicinity should it be approved, would cause such undue interference or destruction. 
F. Erosion control structures. No natural resources special permit shall be issued for the construction, placement, installation, repair, reconstruction, replacement, or alteration of an erosion control structure unless the application for such permit, in addition to complying with the general requirements for issuance of special permits and the requirements of the preceding subsection regarding coastal structures, and subject to the provisions of § 255-3-85 hereof, satisfies the following requirements: 
(1) 
If the application involves a new erosion control structure, the applicant shall demonstrate that erosion control on the project site cannot adequately be accomplished by means of a coastal restoration project, as defined herein, with periodic renourishment or renewal of sand or other materials. 

(2) 
If the application involves a new coastal erosion control structure in Coastal Erosion Overlay Zone 1, 2 or 3, the applicant shall demonstrate that: (i) the erosion control structure is immediately necessary to prevent the loss or destruction of a principal building or structure on the applicant's lot, or to prevent severe damage to such building or structure, (ii) the threatened loss, destruction, or severe damage to a principal building or structure cannot reasonably be prevented by some alternative means, such as relocating the building or structure or undertaking a coastal restoration project, as defined herein, and (iii) the erosion control structure is of the minimum size, design, and physical extent needed to prevent the threatened loss, destruction, or severe damage. 

(3) 
The construction, installation, or other work proposed for the erosion control structure, as well as future repair, maintenance, or restoration of the same, shall not: 

(a) 
Interfere with the littoral transport of sand or other sediment, so as to cause substantial damage to or a measurable increase in erosion of the project site or downdrift beaches, dunes, bluffs, or shoreline. 

(b) 
Cause the loss of identified habitat for important wildlife or native vegetation, including marine life and marine habitat. 

(c) 
Exacerbate flood damage by generating floodborne flotsam. 



(4) 
The erosion control structure shall be designed and constructed according to generally accepted engineering principles, such that the structure will have a reasonable probability of controlling erosion on the project site for a period of at least 30 years. 

(5) 
All materials used in the erosion control structure shall be nontoxic, durable, and capable of withstanding the icing, weathering, inundation, wave impact, and other meteorological and hydrographic conditions to which they will be exposed for a period of at least 30 years. Individual components of the structure may have a working life of less than 30 years if a maintenance program required in connection with the issuance of a permit will ensure that these components are regularly maintained and replaced as necessary to attain the required 30 years of erosion control. 

(6) 
The application shall include a long-term program for the repair, maintenance, or restoration of the structure. That program must include standards for the normal maintenance or replacement of degradable materials and the replacement of sand and vegetative cover. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall require the filing of an appropriate legal instrument against the subject property at the Office of the Suffolk County Clerk in form acceptable to the Town Attorney, which shall require the 


§ 255-5-51 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-5-51 
applicant and all future owners of the property to follow the long-term program for the repair, maintenance, or restoration of the structure. The Zoning Board of Appeals may require that the applicant for an erosion control structure assure the required maintenance by posting an appropriate undertaking and security with the Town. 
G. Water-dependent facilities. The provisions of Subsection F above shall not apply to bulkheads and similar structures which are part of a water-dependent facility in the Waterfront (WF) Use District, or which are part of a lawfully existing marina or recreational marina in any district. 
H. Docks. No dock, pier, wharf, or similar structure (hereafter, "dock") may be authorized by natural resources special permit on residential property or underwater lands adjacent thereto, unless the dock complies with the following standards or limitations, which are in addition to the other standards enumerated in this article for issuance of a natural resources special permit, including those specified with regard to coastal structures in Subsection E above: 
(1) 
If the property in question is already improved with a lawfully preexisting fixed dock, a natural resources special permit may authorize the reconstruction of that dock or its replacement with a new fixed dock. 

(2) 
If the property in question is not already improved with a lawfully preexisting fixed dock, the only type of dock which may be authorized by natural resources special permit is a floating dock, which shall be construed to mean that the dock meets the following requirements: 

(a) 
The horizontal weight-bearing construction on which persons and objects stand (which is itself commonly called the "dock") shall be no greater than five feet in width and shall be designed so that it floats on the surface of the water (i.e., so that it is a "floating dock"); 

(b) 
Every part of the dock except the pilings shall be designed and shall be used so that it is removed during the winter months and reinstalled in the spring (i.e., so that the dock, excepting only the pilings, is "fully removable"); 

(c) 
The dock shall be designed and sited so that, with the exception of the pilings, no part of the dock (including any catwalk and any ramp between a catwalk and the remainder of the dock) will contact the bottomland during a normal low tide; 

(d) 
The dock shall be the minimum length necessary to reach a point where the water depth at the seaward terminus of the dock (inclusive of any catwalk) is three feet at mean low water; provided, however, that such point shall not in any case be more than 80 feet seaward of mean high water, as measured on a perpendicular line from the mean high water mark; 

(e) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection H(1)(a) and (b) above, when necessary to maintain a floating dock in a floating condition through a normal tide range, access between the dock and shore may be provided by means of an elevated fixed walkway (commonly called a "catwalk") not more than five feet in width; provided, however, that no such catwalk shall extend more than 40 feet seaward of mean high water, as measured on a perpendicular line from the mean high water mark; and 

(f) A catwalk shall provide, in appropriate circumstances, for passage by the public along the beach or foreshore, e.g., by means of a removable or raised section (allowing vehicular passage) or steps or a ramp (allowing pedestrian passage). 

(3) 
Before approving a dock under the provisions of Subsection H(2) above, the Board of Appeals shall have first considered all reasonable alternatives which will allow the applicant to safely access and utilize a boat (e.g., rig line and pulley, free swinging mooring). 

(4) 
In considering whether to issue a natural resources special permit for a dock, the Board of Appeals shall consider whether the dock will have any of the following harmful effects: 

(a) 
Whether the dock will impair navigation; 

(b) 
Whether the dock will unduly interfere with the public use of waterways for swimming, boating, fishing, shellfishing, waterskiing, and the like; 

(c) 
Whether the dock will unduly interfere with transit by the public along the public beaches or foreshore; 

(d) 
Whether the dock will significantly impair the use or value of waterfront property adjacent to or near the dock; 

(e) 
Whether the dock will cause degradation of surface water quality; 

(f) 
Whether the dock will result in the destruction of beds of eel grass (Zostera marina) or shellfish; 

(g) 
Whether the dock will unduly restrict tidal flow or water circulation; and 

(h) 
Whether the dock will despoil views from public parklands or roadways. 





I. 
CCA and other treated wood. No natural resources special permit which is required for projects or activities in tidal waters shall allow the use of wood which has been treated with copper chromated arsenate (CCA), ammoniacal copper quat (ACQ), or creosote unless it can be shown that no reasonable alternative material will serve the purpose for which the CCA-, ACQ-, or creasote-treated wood is intended to be used. In determining whether no reasonable alternative to the proposed wood exists, the Board of Appeals shall take into account the cost of alternative materials, their suitability for the intended use (e.g., structural stability), and any environmental benefit to using alternative materials. 

J. 
Harbor Protection Overlay District. For structures, lands, or uses located within the Harbor Protection Overlay District, the disturbance of natural vegetation and topography during construction activities shall be minimized to the greatest degree practicable. To this end, project-limiting fencing, siltation mesh, straw bales, or similar devices for controlling land disturbances and retarding erosion and siltation shall be required during construction and during any clearing or grading of land preparatory to or associated with construction activities. 

K. 
Deposit of materials within Coastal Erosion Overlay District. Apart from structures approved pursuant to this chapter, no fill or other material may be placed or deposited on beaches, dunes, or nearshore areas within the Coastal Erosion Overlay District except clean 


§ 255-5-51 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-5-100 
sand or gravel, having particles of a size equivalent to or slightly larger than that of the materials naturally occurring at the site in question. Where appropriate, such deposited material shall be stabilized by the planting of vegetation. 
§ 255-5-100. Violations. [Amended 9-4-1998 by L.L. No. 30-1998; 3-17-2006 by L.L. No. 7-2006; 7-21-2016 by L.L. No. 32-2016] 
It shall be a violation of this chapter subject to the provisions of Article X hereof for any person to do any of the following: 
A. Failure to obtain special permit. To undertake or commence a use or activity for which a special permit is required by the provisions of this article without having first obtained said special permit. A violation of the provisions of this section shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 or by imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both. 
B. Violation of conditions of special permit. To violate or fail to comply with a condition or requirement of a special permit issued pursuant to this article. In addition to the provisions of Article X hereof, for a period of three years after the date of issuance, the local agency which issued any special permit shall retain jurisdiction and shall have during such period the right to modify, suspend or revoke the permit, in accordance with the standards and procedures for such continuing jurisdiction set forth in § 255-9-25 of this chapter. See also §§ 255-6-100 and 255-8-100 hereof. 
ARTICLE VI 
Site Plan Review 
§ 255-6-10. Purpose. 
The provisions of this article are designed to assure that the design and layout of particular land uses on a lot, whether such use is a permitted, special permit or accessory use, will be such as to ensure the public safety and convenience, will be compatible with certain man-made and natural features on and off the lot and will, in all cases, comply with the letter and spirit of those provisions of this Code which pertain to such design or layout and of those provisions pertaining to the use itself. 
§ 255-6-20. Review authorized; approval required. 
A. Authorization. The Planning Board is hereby authorized to review and approve site plans for the activities and land uses listed herein. No person shall undertake or carry out any such activity or use, including any grading, clearing or tree removal associated therewith, without first having obtained site plan approval therefor, pursuant to the provisions of this article. 
B. Building permits. No building permit required for any such activity or use, including clearing or regrading of land or the erection, construction, alteration, demolition or moving of any structure, shall be issued until the required site plan approval shall have been granted and the conditions of the approved site plan thereafter certified as having been met by the Planning Board Chairman. Such certification shall occur only after all those conditions contained in the resolution of approval or imprinted on the site plan by or on behalf of the Planning Board, which are required to be complied with by the applicant before issuance of a building permit, have been met. In the alternative, the Planning Board may agree to, and the Town Board may by resolution accept, a secured undertaking meeting the requirements of Article XI regarding the same. [Amended 4-2-1993 by L.L. No. 5-1993] 
C. Certificates of occupancy. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all requirements and conditions of the site plan approval have been implemented and an as-built survey, including thereon the location of all buildings, structures and curb cuts, has been submitted to the Building Inspector. 
§ 255-6-25. Installation of fire protection. [Added 12-2-1994 by L.L. No. 14-1994; amended 11-5-1999 by L.L. No. 28-1999] 
Where the installation of one or more hydrants, fire cisterns or fire wells or other fire protection device or system is an element, requirement or condition of site plan approval, said fire protection shall be installed and the installation shall be approved in writing by the Fire Department or district having jurisdiction before construction commences on any building or structure which is part of the site plan. The building permit which authorizes construction of the site plan improvements shall so specify. This restriction shall not apply to structures (other than buildings) which clearly do not require fire protection, such as driveways, sidewalks, parking lots and sewage disposal and stormwater drainage devices.

Exterior lighting which is improperly designed, insufficiently shielded or unnecessarily intense can have a detrimental effect on many of the qualities which the Town seeks to foster and protect. Therefore, in reviewing site plans the Planning Board shall consider the impacts of any proposed exterior lighting on public safety, adjacent property (especially residential property), the natural environment and the general appearance of the Town. To this end, the following specific standards and requirements of this section should be the goal of Planning Board lighting review. The Planning Board shall have the power to vary or modify any standards or requirements, where appropriate, provided that the Board finds that doing so will not negate the purposes of this section. 
A. Location of light fixtures. All exterior light fixtures shall be located so as to minimize or avoid glare and the adverse effects of exterior lighting on nearby properties, especially residential property. 
B. Mounting height. Light fixtures shall be mounted at the lowest practical height, taking into account the area to be illuminated and the relationship between the mounting height and the number of fixtures required to illuminate that area. The following additional standards shall govern the mounting height of fixtures: 
(1) 
The goal should be a mounting height no greater than 12 feet above natural grade unless a greater mounting height is required by the nature of the use or the size of the structure (e.g., boat storage buildings, multiple dwelling units and commercial garages). 

(2) 
(Reserved) 


C. Type of lamp. The following types of lamps shall not be permitted: 
(1)

Pursuant to Table IV227 of § 255-11-10 hereof, the Planning Board shall have power during site plan review to reduce the yard setbacks which would otherwise apply to accessory buildings and structures in business or commercial-industrial use districts. In making a determination to approve such reduced yard setbacks, the Planning Board shall find that doing so serves the interests of good planning. The Board shall consider in this regard: 
A. Size and shape of lot: the size and configuration of the lot on which the structures are proposed. 
B. Residential property: the proximity of the structures to residential property and the effect which the proposed structures might have on an existing or future residential use of that land. 
C. Coordinated development: the potential for coordinating development with adjacent property and the extent to which lessening the accessory structure setbacks might aid such coordination. 
D. Buffering and screening: the degree to which buffering or screening is necessary or can be provided for the structures.

ARTICLE VII 
Architectural and Design Review 
§ 255-7-10. Purposes. [Amended 10-19-1999 by L.L. No. 26-1999] 
These procedures are established to provide for review and approval of the architecture, design, scale and style of certain classes of buildings and structures, and for the design, scale and architectural compatibility of historic landmarks and structures and improvements within designated historic districts. The Town of East Hampton possesses a rich architectural heritage dating from colonial times. The enduring charm of local residences, shops and other buildings, together with the historic associations which many of these buildings have with each other and with the streetscape, constitute a visual and cultural resource which has allowed the Town to be acclaimed as one of the most beautiful and historic communities in the nation. Enduring rural charm and historic character have also served to support the area's resort economy, which has grown to rival or surpass the Town's traditional economic cornerstones of farming and fishing. Yet the growth of the Town's resort economy, with its economic benefits, also possesses the potential to destroy the rural character upon which it is based. Continued prosperity requires the preservation of those things that make the Town a desirable and attractive place for residents and visitors alike. To this end, it is important to ensure that commercial building design and, in certain circumstances, residential building design are harmonious with the Town's essential character. Excessive uniformity or dissimilarity of design should generally be avoided, as should design which is inappropriate to the traditional and historic character of East Hampton architecture. It is also important that alterations to historic buildings and their surroundings be consistent with the historic and architectural qualities of those buildings and places, and that the architectural integrity of historic buildings is maintained. The reasonable design criteria and review procedures established herein will help to achieve these goals and thereby serve to protect and enhance property values, private investments, and the character, historical interest, beauty and general welfare of the Town.

This provision shall be deemed to include those structures which would otherwise be exempted from architectural and design review pursuant to Subsections A and C above. For the purposes of this subsection, an "exterior alteration" to a building or structure shall include a material change in the exterior elements of such building or structure, such as a change in the location or appearance of steps, doors, windows, shutters, siding, roofing, lighting fixtures and trim, whether or not a building permit is required for the change, and shall include such exterior changes as are described in Subsection E below.

Painting or staining a structure so as to change its exterior color, or placing siding on a structure which differs in design, style, color or appearance from its preexisting siding, shall be deemed to be exterior changes that are regulated by this subsection. For a building or structure which is regulated under this subsection solely because it is an historic landmark or is located on a property designated as an historic landmark or is within an historic district, Architectural Review Board approval of an exterior change described herein shall not be necessary if the change is exempt from review under any guidelines or regulations adopted by the Town Board pursuant to § 255-7-25D. [Amended 6-2-2000 by L.L. No. 6-2000; 2-2-2007 by L.L. No. 7-2007]

§ 255-7-40. Application and submission requirements. [Amended 10-19-1999 by L.L. No. 26-1999] 
A. Activities requiring building permits. In addition to the requirement of § 255-6-72B of this chapter that copies of building permit applications subject to site plan review be forwarded by the Building Inspector to the Architectural Review Board for review and approval, the Building Inspector shall also forward to the Architectural Review Board one complete copy of every building permit application for buildings, structures, activities or uses set forth in Subsections B through F of § 255-7-30 hereof, together with two sets of all plans, drawings, renderings and specifications which have been submitted to him therewith. No building permit shall be issued for any such project until and unless architectural and design approval shall first have been granted by the Architectural Review Board pursuant to this article. 
B. Activities not requiring building permits. A person intending to carry out any exterior alteration or other change to the exterior of a building or structure as described in Subsection D or Subsection E of § 255-7-30, for which exterior alteration or other change a building permit is not required, shall make direct application to the Architectural Review Board for approval of the alteration or other change. Such application shall be made on the form prescribed for same by the Review Board. Two sets of working drawings, if any, shall accompany the application, as well as samples of colors and materials involved, if appropriate. Upon receipt, the Review Board shall process and act upon the application as if the same were a building permit application referred to the Review Board by the Building Inspector under this section. No person shall undertake or carry out any such exterior change unless the approval of the Architectural Review Board pursuant to this article shall have been first obtained therefor. 
C. Additional submissions. In addition to the submission requirements of Subsections A and B above, the Architectural Review Board may require that an applicant before said Board submit any additional materials which the Review Board may reasonably require in order to visualize the proposed work and properly consider the application.

§ 255-7-50. Procedure. [Amended 10-19-1999 by L.L. No. 26-1999] 
Upon receipt of a building permit application referred by the Building Inspector or receipt of an application made directly to the Board for approval of a proposed exterior alteration or other exterior change, as well as receipt of any additional materials required by the Board, the Architectural Review Board shall follow the procedures set forth in Article IX hereof regarding the processing of applications. 
§ 255-7-60. Standards and criteria. [Amended 10-18-1996 by L.L. No. 17-1996; 10-19-1999 by L.L. No. 26-1999] 
A. General standards. The following standards and criteria shall govern architectural and design review under this article, subject to the more specific standards pertaining to historic landmarks and historic districts which are set forth in Subsection B hereof: 
(1) 
Maintenance of character. In accordance with the purposes set forth in § 255-7-10 above, the Architectural Review Board is charged with maintaining the desirable character of the Town and with disapproving the construction, reconstruction, alteration or repositioning of buildings or structures which are designed without consideration of the harmonious relation of the new or altered structure to such structures as already exist and/or to the setting and physical environment into which such structures are to be placed, ensuring compliance with existing applicable scenic, agricultural and conservation easements or purchase of developments rights agreements in, upon or adjacent to the premises, as to which the Town, a conservation organization or a homeowners' association is a grantee or a party, and ensuring that any instruments filed upon adjoining properties are not unduly impaired by the proposed improvements. To accomplish the purposes set forth in § 255-7-10, the Board shall encourage traditional architectural treatments such as gabled roofs and the use of cedar shingles or other natural wood siding. However, the Board shall not be precluded from taking into account the use district in which a new or altered structure is proposed to be placed and the relative visibility of the structure to the general public, and may draw distinctions in its review or approval of structures based on material differences in the locations of such structures. [Amended 6-20-2019 by L.L. No. 28-2019] 

(2) 
Assurance of harmony. The Review Board is further charged with exercising sound judgment and with rejection of plans which, in its opinion, based on study and advice, are not of harmonious character because of proposed style, scale, materials, mass, line, color, detail or placement upon the property of proposed buildings or structures or in relation to the spaces between buildings or the natural character of the landscape or because of lack of provision for balance between the proposed location and design of structures and adjacent open areas or adjacent existing structures, whether on or off the lot or site in question. 


§ 255-7-60 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-7-60 
(3) 
Nature of review. The Review Board shall not design or assist in the design of any buildings, structures or projects submitted to it for approval except on request of the applicant or his architect or agent. The Board shall restrict its considerations to a reasonable and professional review of the proposal and plans, leaving responsibility for design and development to the applicant. 

(4) 
Flexibility. Individual initiative and experimentation are not to be discouraged unless necessary to carry out the duties of the Board hereunder. Though the preferred and historic type of construction is wood frame and exterior, the Review Board is not to use design review intentionally or inadvertently to prohibit or unduly restrict alternative building types, materials or methods, in cases where these alternatives can also fulfill the purposes of this article. 

(5) 
Standardized designs. The Review Board shall not be constrained by the preferences of a particular applicant (such as a large corporation or a chain store) for a distinguishing motif, style or design which the applicant uses generally for other structures within the Town or elsewhere. The Board shall not approve such a standardized project or design unless the Board can and does find that such approval will satisfy the standards and criteria set forth in this section. 

(6) 
Basis for disapproval. Only the applicant's failure to take reasonable account of the considerations set forth in § 255-7-10 and in this section shall justify the disapproval of a proposal. This standard shall not apply to applications concerning historic landmarks and districts; all such applications will be governed by the standards set forth in Subsection B, General standards for historic landmarks and historic districts. 


[Amended 12-18-2009 by L.L. No. 29-2009] 
(7) Other considerations. In its endeavor to improve the quality of a design, the Review Board shall keep considerations of cost in mind, but shall not authorize a design violative of this article on the basis of cost. The Board shall not for any reason approve any plan or design in violation of any requirement of the Town Code. To this end, the Review Board shall consult with the Building Inspector and the Fire Prevention Inspector whenever necessary and shall urge applicants to do so at the earliest possible stage as well. 
B. General standards for historic landmarks and historic districts. In addition to the standards set forth in Subsection A above, when considering applications for an historic landmark or for property within an historic district the Architectural Review Board shall be governed by the standards and criteria set forth in this subsection. 
(1) 
Preservation of historic character. The historic character of landmarks and properties within historic districts shall be retained and preserved. To that end, the removal or alteration of those historic materials and features which characterize such properties shall be avoided. 

(2) 
Compatibility of alterations. Any additions or exterior alterations made to buildings or structures on property designated as a landmark or located within an historic district shall be compatible with the historic character of the landmark or historic district. 

(3) 
Compatibility of new construction. Any buildings or structures which are erected, constructed or placed on property designated as a landmark or located within an 


historic district shall be compatible with the historic character of the landmark or historic district. 
(4) In applying the principle of compatibility as set forth in this subsection, the Architectural Review Board shall consider the following factors: 
(a) 
The general design, character and appropriateness to the property of the proposed alteration, addition or new construction. 

(b) 
The scale of the proposed alteration, addition or new construction in relation to the property itself, surrounding properties and the historic district, if any. 

(c) 
The texture, color and type of materials used and their relation to similar features of other structures which are part of the landmark or are within the historic district. 

(d) 
The visual compatibility of the proposed alteration, addition or new construction with the landmark or with other properties within the historic district, including proportion of the affected property's front facade, proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings within the facade, massing, height, roof shape, use of architectural details and the rhythm of spacing between structures along a street, including setbacks from the street. 

(e) 
The importance of historic, architectural or other features to the significance of the property. 


C. Specific standards for individual historic landmarks and historic districts. The Town Board may, by local law pursuant to § 255-7-25D hereof, adopt and from time to time amend a set of review guidelines for each historic landmark or historic district designated by said Board, which guidelines shall be used by the Architectural Review Board to apply the general criteria set forth in Subsection B above to the specific historic and architectural characteristics of each landmark or district. [Amended 6-2-2000 by L.L. No. 6-2000] 
D. Specific standards for special historic landmarks: In addition to the general standards of § 255-7-60B, in reviewing an application for expansion of a special historic landmark house or for construction of an accessory dwelling unit on a property, the Architectural Review Board shall consider: [Added 12-7-2017 by L.L. No. 44-2017] 
(1) 
The extent to which the proposal achieves the goal of maintaining or enhancing the integrity of the special historic landmark house and its setting, particularly its setting when viewed from the street. 

(2) 
The extent to which the proposal keeps the special historic landmark house intact with no additions; or when this option is not available, minimizes any additions and keeps any additions subordinate in size and scale to the special historic landmark house. Whenever possible, the Architectural Review Board shall encourage property owners to maintain the integrity of the special historic landmark by avoiding additions, if transferring expansion to a second dwelling is possible. 


§ 255-7-61. Validity of Architectural Review Board approval. [Added 3-1-2012 by L.L. No. 5-2012] 
Time for obtaining a building permit. An Architectural Review Board approval shall be valid for 
§ 255-7-61 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-7-100 
a period of three years from the date on which the Chairman certifies that all conditions of the approval have been met. The Architectural Review Board may by resolution extend the approval for additional one-year periods. 
§ 255-7-90. Advisory review for historic landmarks and historic district properties owned by Town of East Hampton. [Added 11-14-2002 by L.L. No. 36-2002; amended 2-2-2007 by L.L. No. 7-2007] 
The provisions of this article which pertain to historic landmarks and historic districts shall also constitute advisory guidelines for any property or structures owned by the Town of East Hampton that are designated as historic landmarks or are located within a designated historic district, to the extent set forth herein. No agency, authority, department, bureau, board, body, or officer of the Town of East Hampton shall carry out any activity described in § 255-7-30D hereof without first applying for and obtaining a report regarding said activity from the Architectural Review Board. Such report shall set forth the Architectural Review Board's opinion of how the proposed activity meets or does not meet the standards and criteria set forth in § 255-7-60B and any guidelines adopted by the Town Board for the subject landmark or historic district. In addition, such report shall consider any alternatives and offer any recommendations that the Architectural Review Board may suggest for the proposed activity to better meet said standards, criteria, and/or guidelines. The Architectural Review Board shall submit its advisory report to the Town Board and to the agency, authority, department, bureau, board, body, or officer the making the application. 
§ 255-7-100. Violations. [Amended 9-4-1998 by L.L. No. 30-1998; 10-19-1999 by L.L. No. 26-1999; 3-17-2006 by L.L. No. 7-2006; 7-21-2016 by L.L. No. 32-2016]

The manner of such filing shall be governed by the provisions of Subsection B hereof and not by the provisions of New York Town Law § 267-a, Subdivision 5. For this purpose, the provisions of Town Law § 267-a, Subdivision 5, which specify filing in the Town Clerk's office are superseded pursuant to the Town's home rule powers under Article 9, § 2(b)(3) of the New York State Constitution, § 10, Subdivision 6, of the Statute of Local Governments, and § 10, Subdivisions 1(ii)a(3), 1(ii)a(11) and 1(ii)a(14) of the Municipal Home Rule Law.

(2) 
When he has mailed or otherwise caused to be delivered notice of the same to any owner, lessee, contract vendee, mortgagee or other person having a legal or equitable interest in the affected premises, or to any agent of any of the above parties.230

Every such application shall refer to the specific provision(s) of this chapter involved and, as the case may be, shall set forth the interpretation that is claimed, the use for which a special permit is sought or the details of the variance applied for and the grounds on which it is claimed that the same should be granted. The required fee established by the Town Board pursuant to § 255-9-26 shall accompany the application. Upon receipt of any application which it finds to be complete and in compliance herewith, the Board of Appeals shall follow the procedure set forth in Article IX hereof for the processing of applications. 
§ 255-8-45. (Reserved) 
§ 255-8-50. Standards. 
The following standards and criteria shall govern determinations made by the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
A. Appeals and interpretations. [Amended 10-19-1999 by L.L. No. 26-1999] 
(1) 
Appeals from the Building Inspector and interpretations of provisions of this chapter. In deciding an appeal from an interpretation of a provision of this chapter made by the Building Inspector, or an appeal from any other order, requirement, decision or determination made by him, the Board of Appeals shall keep in mind the findings, purposes and goals of the Town's Comprehensive Plan and the purposes of this chapter as set forth in Article I and other parts thereof, as well as the findings of any local law enacting or amending the language at issue. The Board shall follow any specific standards or limitations set forth in this chapter which govern the question and shall give great weight to the above factors as indicative of legislative purpose and intent. Appeals relating to § 255-8-32 hereof (occupancy of a dwelling unit by a family) shall be governed by the provisions of Subsection F below. 

(2) 
Appeals from the Architectural Review Board. The Board of Appeals shall not reverse, in whole or part, a decision of the Architectural Review Board, unless the Board of Appeals shall find and fully set forth in its determination that the Review Board's decision would cause the applicant or the owner of the property an unreasonable economic hardship if left undisturbed. [Amended 6-2-2000 by L.L. No. 6-2000] 

(3) 
In making any determination under this chapter, among other factors to be considered as outlined in this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall, when applicable, consider the location and metes and bounds of existing scenic, agricultural, and conservation easements and purchases of development rights agreements in, upon, or adjacent to the premises under review, to which the Town of East Hampton, a conservation organization or a homeowners' association is a grantee or a party, and the impact of the proposed action upon the benefits conferred by such easements and/ or development rights. [Added 6-20-2019 by L.L. No. 28-2019]

Downloaded from https://ecode360.com/EA0658 on 2023-11-07 
B. Special permits. In deciding whether to grant a special permit the administration of which has been given to it by Article V of this chapter, the Board of Appeals shall apply the general standards and specific standards and safeguards, if any, set forth in Article V. 
C. Use variances. The Board of Appeals shall not grant any use variance, so as to allow a use of land in a manner or for a purpose which is otherwise not allowed or is prohibited by the use tables231 contained in this chapter, unless the Board shall find and fully set forth in its determination that the applicant has shown unnecessary hardship, which shall mean that: 
(1) 
Under the use regulations contained in this chapter, the applicant cannot realize a reasonable economic return from the property, lot or land in question, under any of the uses permitted by this chapter, and that such lack of reasonable return is substantial and has been established by competent financial evidence. 

(2) 
Notwithstanding anything which may be to the contrary in § 267-b of the New York Town Law or in any other provision of the Town Law relating to Zoning Boards of Appeals, the applicant shall have the burden of showing that the benefit accruing to him from grant of the requested variance outweighs any harm which will be caused to the neighborhood or the Town, and that the variance requested is the minimum variance needed to alleviate his difficulty while safeguarding the character of the neighborhood and the general welfare of the Town. In making this determination, among other factors outlined in this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the location and metes and bounds of existing scenic, agricultural, and conservation easements and purchases of development rights agreements in, upon, or adjacent to the premises under review, to which the Town of East Hampton, a conservation organization or a homeowners' association is a grantee or a party, and the impact of the proposed variance(s) upon the benefits conferred by such easements and/or development rights. [Amended 6-20-2019 by L.L. No. 28-2019] 

(3) 
The use variance to be granted will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood. 

(4) 
The hardship relating to the property has not been self-created. 

(5) 
The use variance to be granted is the minimum variance necessary and adequate to alleviate the unnecessary hardship shown by the applicant, while at the same time preserving and protecting the character of the neighborhood and the general health, safety and welfare of the Town as a whole. 


D. Area variances. The following provisions shall govern applications for area variances: 
[Amended 5-15-1998 by L.L. No. 20-1998] 
(1) The Board of Appeals shall not grant any area variance, waiving strict application of the area or dimensional requirements of this chapter, unless the Board shall find and fully set forth in its determination that: 
(a) The benefit to the applicant from grant of the area variance outweighs any detriment which grant of the variance will cause to the general health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or the Town as a whole; and 
231.Editor's Note: The use tables are included at the end of this chapter. 
§ 255-8-50 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-8-50 
(b) The area variance to be granted is the minimum variance necessary and adequate to alleviate the difficulty causing the applicant to request an area variance, while at the same time preserving and protecting the character of the neighborhood and the general health, safety and welfare of the Town as a whole. 
(2) 
Notwithstanding anything which may be to the contrary in § 267-b of the New York Town Law or in any other provision of the Town Law relating to Zoning Boards of Appeals, the applicant shall have the burden of showing that the benefit accruing to him from grant of the requested variance outweighs any harm which will be caused to the neighborhood or the Town, and that the variance requested is the minimum variance needed to alleviate his difficulty while safeguarding the character of the neighborhood and the general welfare of the Town. 

(3) 
In deciding whether to grant an area variance, the Board shall consider the following factors: 

(a) 
Whether the grant of the variance will cause an undesirable change in the character of the neighborhood or will create a detriment to nearby properties; 

(b) 
Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method, feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance; 

(c) 
Whether the requested area variance is substantial; 

(d) 
Whether the grant of the variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood or in the affected area of the Town; and 

(e) 
Whether the difficulty causing the applicant to request an area variance was self-created, which consideration shall be relevant to the determination of the Board but shall not necessarily preclude the grant of the variance. 




E. (Reserved)232 
F. Occupancy by family. 
(1) A group of more than four unrelated persons shall be deemed to constitute a single-family for the purpose of occupying a dwelling unit only if the group is the functional equivalent of either of the two entities described in Subsection A of the definition of "family," found at § 255-1-20 of this chapter. The Board of Appeals shall determine that a group of more than four unrelated persons is a family only if it finds that: 
(a) 
The group is one which in size, function and structure resembles a traditional family unit. 

(b) 
The group will live and cook together as a single housekeeping unit. 

(c) 
The group is of a permanent nature and is neither a framework for transient or seasonal living nor merely an association or relationship which is transient or seasonal in nature. 


232.Editor's Note: Former Subsection E, Variances from requirements of Flood Hazard Overlay District, as amended, wasrepealed 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007. See now § 255-8-62A. 
Downloaded from https://ecode360.com/EA0658 on 2023-11-07 
(d) All other requirements of this chapter regarding the use and occupancy of the dwelling unit in which the group resides will be met. 
(2) Any determination under this subsection that a particular group of persons constitutes a family shall constitute a determination as to the status of that particular group only and shall not be interpreted as authorizing any other occupancy, use or activity. 
G. The revocation of a certificate of occupancy. The Board of Appeals shall find that a certificate of occupancy was properly revoked by the Building Inspector only if the Board finds and fully sets forth in its determination that: [Added 10-7-2005 by L.L. No. 32-2005] 
(1) 
There has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application, plans or specifications upon which the building permit was issued; 

(2) 
There has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application for a certificate of occupancy; 

(3) 
The certificate of occupancy was issued in error; or 

(4) 
The certificate of occupancy was issued in conflict with the applicable law. 


§ 255-8-60. Limitations on certain variances. [Amended 1-16-1997 by L.L. No. 2-1997] 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of the New York Town Law as it relates to Zoning Boards of Appeals and their power to grant variances, the authority of the Board of Appeals to grant variances shall be limited as provided in this section. 
A. Expansion of nonconforming buildings ("50% cap"). Nonconforming buildings should not be capable of unlimited enlargement in a manner which continues to transgress the applicable setbacks, even through the grant of variances by the Zoning Board of Appeals. To that end, the following rules shall limit the authority of the Zoning Board of Appeals: 
(1) 
The Board of Appeals shall have no power to grant a variance or variances which would increase the gross floor area of the nonconforming portion of a nonconforming building by more than 50%. For the purposes of this subsection, the "gross floor area of the nonconforming portion of a nonconforming building" shall be the cumulative gross floor area of any part or parts of a building which are located within a required yard, natural resources, pyramid law or other setback. Furthermore, in computing the "gross floor area of the nonconforming portion of a nonconforming building," the figure used shall be that which existed on the date the building first became nonconforming as to any Town setback requirement. See also § 255-1-42 hereof. 

(2) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A(1), the Board of Appeals shall be authorized to grant a variance or variances which would increase the gross floor area of a nonconforming building in the following instances: 

(a) 
If the variance(s) would increase the gross floor area of the nonconforming portion of a nonconforming building by no more than 300 square feet; or 

(b) 
If the variance(s) would increase the gross floor area of the building as a whole to no more than 1,200 square feet. 




B. Small lots. The intended beneficial results of upgraded zoning requirements in established 
§ 255-8-60 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-8-62 
neighborhoods and other areas is sometimes defeated by continued creation of nonconforming lots in such areas by variance. Such haphazard creation of nonconforming lots (as opposed to creation of small lots as part of a controlled overall Town housing strategy) is hereby found to be disruptive of the goals of sound planning and land use, injurious to the health, safety and general welfare of the community and against public policy. Therefore, in deciding whether to grant a requested variance for the division of a residentially zoned lot into two or more nonconforming lots, one or more of which would not contain an existing residence, the Board of Appeals shall confine its deliberations to the standards set forth in § 255-8-50D hereof and shall not be compelled to grant any such variance solely because of the size of adjacent lots, the average size of lots in the neighborhood or any other similar narrow consideration. 
C. (Reserved)233 
D. Urban renewal maps. The Board of Appeals may approve a change in the lot line configuration of or the division, diminishment or expansion of lots located in an urban renewal map subject to and conditioned upon the Town Board's determination to amend the Urban Renewal Plan to reflect such reconfigurations, division, diminishment or expansion but shall not issue variances authorizing or resulting in changes to streets, access, frontage, road improvement units or any other specific feature or requirements of any such plan, or of Chapter 232.234 [Amended 9-20-2005 by L.L. No. 29-2005] 
§ 255-8-62. Variances in Flood Hazard Overlay District and Coastal Erosion Overlay District. [Added 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
A. Variances from requirements of Flood Hazard Overlay District. A variance from the Town's Flood Hazard Overlay District requirements shall be deemed an area variance. Nevertheless, pursuant to Article 36 of the Environmental Conservation Law and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in § 255-8-50D hereof or in § 267-b of the Town Law or any other provision of the Town Law relating to the standards for the granting of area variances, the review of variances from the requirements of said overlay district shall be governed by the following provisions: 
(1) 
The Board of Appeals shall not grant any variance from the requirements of the Flood Hazard Overlay District (found at § 255-3-40 et seq. hereof) unless the Board shall find and fully set forth in its determination that the applicant has shown exceptional hardship, which shall mean that: 

(a) 
The applicant cannot reasonably comply with the requirement from which a variance is sought; and 

(b) 
Grant of the variance will not result in an undue threat to human health or safety, will not result in an undue risk of damage to public or private property, will not increase flood heights, and will not cause extraordinary public expense. 



(2) 
The applicant shall have the burden of establishing the existence of exceptional hardship and shall show that, in view of the flood hazard, the variance sought is the

Downloaded from https://ecode360.com/EA0658 on 2023-11-07 
minimum variance necessary to afford him relief. In deciding whether to grant a variance under this subsection, the Board shall consider the following factors: 
(a) 
The degree of difficulty which the applicant would have in complying with the requirement; 

(b) 
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of floodwaters at the applicant's property, and the effects of wave action, if applicable; 

(c) 
The extent of the danger to life and property due to flooding or flood-caused erosion of the applicant's land; 

(d) 
The susceptibility of any proposed structure or use, or its contents, to flood damage and the effects of such damage on the applicant; 

(e) 
The importance of the benefits provided to the community by the applicant's proposed structure or use; 

(f) 
The applicant's need for a waterfront location, where applicable; 

(g) 
The availability of alternative locations for the proposed structure or use which are not as subject to flooding or erosion damage; 

(h) 
The compatibility of the proposed structure or use with existing and anticipated development in its vicinity; 

(i) 
The relationship of the proposed structure or use to the Town's Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program for the area; 

(j) 
The safety of vehicular access to the applicant's property in times of flood; 

(k) 
The cost of governmental services associated with flooding of the applicant's property, such as search and rescue operations, post-storm clean-up, and restoration of public facilities and utilities; and 

(l) 
The dangers associated with search and rescue operations involving the applicant's property during periods of flooding. 


(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a variance may be granted for the repair or rehabilitation of an historic structure, as defined herein, if the requirements of Subsection A(1)(b) above are met and the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. 
B. Limitation on variances from requirements of Coastal Erosion Overlay District. Any variance from the prohibition of erosion control structures in certain areas of the Town, as set forth in § 255-3-85B hereof, shall be deemed an area variance and subject to the standards set forth in § 255-8-50 hereof. Nevertheless, pursuant to Article 34 of the Environmental Conservation Law and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in § 255-8-50 hereof or in § 267-b of the Town Law or any other provision of the Town Law relating to the standards for grant of area variances, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall not grant a variance to allow the construction, placement, installation, maintenance, repair, replacement, or alteration of an erosion control structure which extends perpendicular to the shoreline (such as a groin or jetty), unless such structure is necessary to ensure the safe 
§ 255-8-62 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-8-82 
navigability of a boat channel. 
§ 255-8-65. Lot area variances. 
No area variance application which involves the subdivision of land, where one or more of the lots to be created does not comply with the minimum dimensional requirements of this chapter, shall be deemed complete unless application for approval of such subdivision shall have been made to the Planning Board and proof of the receipt of such application forwarded to the Zoning Board of Appeals. In any such application, the Board of Appeals shall solicit a written recommendation of the Planning Board concerning the grant of the requested variance or variances, as required by § 277, Subdivision 6, of the Town Law. 
§ 255-8-70. (Reserved) 
§ 255-8-80. Alternate procedures. 
As more particularly set forth in the following sections, the Board of Appeals may follow alternate review procedures with respect to certain types of applications and approvals over which it has been given jurisdiction hereunder. 
§ 255-8-82. Variances not requiring hearings. 
A. Authority to waive public hearing. The Board of Appeals may waive the holding of a public hearing for any application for a variance from the provisions of a front, rear or side yard setback required in a Dimensional Table of § 255-11-10 hereof or required in § 255-1-43 hereof, provided that the variance would not reduce the setback in question by more than 25% or 10 feet, whichever shall be the lesser distance. 
B. Requirement of notice. In the event that the Board elects to waive the holding of a public hearing on an application for a variance pursuant to this section, both the Board and the applicant shall give notice of the nature and extent of the variance sought in the manner prescribed by § 255-9-23 hereof for the giving of notice on public hearings. The following procedures shall be followed in giving such notice: 
(1) 
The Board shall cause a notice to be published in the official newspaper in accordance with the requirements of § 255-9-23. The notice shall state that comments or objections to the grant of the variance shall be made to the Board in writing no later than 10 days from the date of the appearance of the notice in the official newspaper (the "notice date"). 

(2) 
The applicant shall erect a sign on the premises giving notice of the application and shall send notice to adjoining property owners by certified mail, in accordance with the requirements of § 255-9-23. The giving of notice in this manner shall be accomplished no later than the notice date described above, and the applicant shall file with the Board an affidavit that he has complied with this provision, together with the postal receipts evidencing notification of the abutting property owners. 

(3) 
The Board shall not grant the variance until the applicant has filed with the Board the affidavit and postal receipts described in the preceding subsection. 


C. Hearing required. At any time prior to the grant of a variance under this section, the Board of Appeals may determine for any reason that a public hearing must be held on the application and shall set the application for a hearing at the earliest practicable time. The Board shall be required to hold a public hearing on an application processed under this section if, within 10 days of the notice date described above, the Board receives one or more written objections to the grant of the variance without a public hearing. 
D. Town Law superseded. To the extent that § 267-a of the New York Town Law may require or be construed to require that the Zoning Board of Appeals hold a public hearing prior to the grant of a variance, Town Law § 267-a is hereby superseded pursuant to the Town's powers under Article 9, § 2(b)(3), of the New York State Constitution; § 10, Subdivision 6, of the Statute of Local Governments; and § 10, Subdivision 1(ii)a(3), (11) and (14), of the Municipal Home Rule Law. 
§ 255-8-84. Administrative natural resources special permits. 
A. Administrative permits. The Planning Department of the Town of East Hampton shall in certain cases have the power to process and review applications for natural resources special permits (hereinafter called "administrative natural resources special permits") and to approve, conditionally approve, modify and approve or deny such permits. 
B. Jurisdiction; nature of permit. Except as provided for herein, the Planning Department shall exercise sole jurisdiction over administrative natural resources special permits and the review of applications received by the Town for the same. Such authority shall be exercised by the Department for and on behalf of the Zoning Board of Appeals and, except as otherwise specified herein, the determinations of the Planning Department with regard to natural resources special permit applications, which it processes and decides under this section, shall have the same force and effect as if such applications had been reviewed and acted upon by the Board of Appeals. Grant of any such administrative permit shall constitute an action as defined in the Environmental Conservation Law and in the regulations promulgated by the State Department of Environmental Conservation under that law. 
C. Informal procedures. Unless specifically provided otherwise herein, review of applications for administrative natural resources special permits conducted by the Planning Department shall not include or involve the holding of formal public hearings, the taking of sworn or unsworn testimony, the making of transcripts or the keeping of minutes or other formal records of proceedings. The issuance or conditional issuance of an administrative natural resources special permit authorized herein by the Department shall not require the making of formal findings or determinations by the Department or by any other Town department or agency, except as may be required by the Environmental Conservation Law or Chapter 75 of the Town Code. 
D. Receipt of applications. All applications for administrative natural resources special permits shall be submitted to and received for the Town by the Building Inspector, in the same manner as he receives and processes all other applications for natural resources special permits. The Building Inspector shall accept only applications which he finds to be facially complete and for which the appropriate fee has been received. One copy of each application accepted shall be forwarded immediately to the Planning Department, the Town Engineer, the Director of Natural Resources, and the Town Trustees (where applicable). Within five days after receipt of the application, the Town Engineer and the Director of Natural Resources shall advise the Planning Department as to whether they require additional information from the applicant. [Amended 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
§ 255-8-84 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-8-84 
E. Review of applications. The Planning Department shall review every application forwarded to the Department by the Building Inspector for completeness. Within 10 days after receipt of the application by the Town Building Inspector, the Planning Department shall issue either a notice of complete application as specified below or a request to the applicant for additional information. The Department shall thereafter collect and compile any information necessary to an informed and thorough review of the application, shall conduct a site inspection, and shall formulate its analysis and recommendations regarding proper disposition of the application, including appropriate mitigation measures in the event a permit should issue. The Department shall solicit comments and recommendations from the Department of Natural Resources, the Town Engineer, and the Town Trustees (where applicable), which shall have a maximum of 14 days to respond. After receipt of all information necessary to meet the above requirements, and at the end of any comment period prescribed in Subsection F, the Planning Department shall either issue an administrative natural resources special permit or shall refer the matter to the Zoning Board of Appeals for public hearing and decision because one or more of the conditions listed in Subsection J below are found to exist. If for any such reason it is determined that a particular application cannot be further processed administratively by the Planning Department, the Board of Appeals shall be so informed by the Department, and the Board shall schedule and hold a public hearing on the application at the earliest practicable time and shall thereafter proceed to decide the application in the usual manner. [Amended 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
F. Publication and notice; comment period. Except as to applications made pursuant to § 255-4-28 hereof for coastal restoration projects or the repair or reconstruction of certain coastal structures, which are governed by the provisions of Subsection H, once an application is deemed complete the Planning Department shall send a notice of complete application to the Board of Appeals, the official newspaper, and the applicant. If one or more official Town forms have been designed for these purposes, such forms shall be employed. Notice sent by the Department to the official newspaper shall be in form ready to be published, shall state that the application is one which may result in the issuance of a permit by the Department without a public hearing being held thereon, and shall inform the public that comments on the application or requests that a public hearing be held must be received by the Town within 20 days after the date of publication in the official newspaper (the "notice date"). Notice sent by the Department to the applicant must inform the applicant of his responsibilities to post the property and to mail copies of the notice of application or other similar approved form to all neighboring property owners as detailed in § 255-9-23 hereof. Notices sent by the Department to the applicant for forwarding to neighbors shall inform such persons that comments on the application or requests that a public hearing be held thereon must be received by the Town within 20 days of the "notice date." [Amended 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
G. Final administrative processing. If none of the conditions listed in Subsection J below are found to exist, a draft natural resources special permit may be prepared by the Department. This permit shall be mailed by the Planning Department with a cover letter informing the applicant that, unless he submits to the Planning Department within 10 days a written request for modification of the draft permit or an objection to one or more conditions of the draft permit, the final permit will issue as originally drafted. Any objection or modification request so submitted shall be considered by the Planning Department, which may elect to modify the final permit accordingly. If such a modification is made, the final permit issued by the Planning Department shall reflect the modification; otherwise it shall be identical to 
the originally issued draft. [Amended 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
H. Expedited review for coastal restoration projects and the repair or reconstruction of certain coastal structures. In the case of an application for a coastal restoration project or for the repair or reconstruction of certain coastal structures, as enumerated in and pursuant to § 255-4-28 hereof, the publication, notice, and public comment requirements of Subsection F shall not apply. In such applications, after receipt of all information required by the Planning Department pursuant to Subsection E, the Department shall either issue an administrative natural resources special permit or, within five days, refer the matter to the Zoning Board of Appeals, in accordance with the procedures for all other administrative natural resources special permits. At the request of an applicant for an expedited permit under this subsection, the Planning Department may waive the preparation and mailing of a draft permit as would be required by Subsection G. Where the Planning Department finds that the work proposed is neither a coastal restoration project nor the repair or reconstruction of a coastal structure as authorized in § 255-4-28, the application may not be processed under this subsection and shall be subject to the procedural requirements governing all other applications for administrative natural resources special permits. 
[Amended 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
I. Appeals; hearing de novo. An applicant may appeal the Planning Department's decision not to issue an administrative natural resources special permit or the imposition in any permit issued by the Department of one or more particular conditions. Any such appeal shall be deemed procedurally and for all other purposes an entirely new application to the Board of Appeals for a nonadministrative natural resources special permit, and the Board of Appeals shall hear and decide the matter on that basis. The Board may make use of documents and materials already submitted by the applicant or produced by the Planning Department. No new fee shall be charged an applicant for the further processing of the application. 
[Amended 4-13-2007 by L.L. No. 14-2007] 
J. Exceptions. The following applications for natural resources special permits shall be processed and heard by the Zoning Board of Appeals in the ordinary manner and shall not be eligible for administrative review and approval by the Planning Department: 
(1) 
Applications requiring the grant of one or more variances. 

(2) 
Applications for which the Planning Department recommends preparation of a draft environmental impact statement. 

(3) 
Applications for which the Planning Department recommends purchase by the Town of all or part of the property involved. 

(4) 
Applications which the Town Natural Resources Director, Town Planning Director or any member of the Board of Appeals requests be heard and determined by the Board of Appeals, provided that such request shall have been made in writing to the Board of Appeals prior to issuance of the final administrative natural resources permit by the Planning Department. 

(5) 
Applications as to which there is substantial public controversy. Substantial public controversy shall be deemed to exist in any case where the Town has timely received from one or more persons a clearly articulated, factually based allegation in writing that issuance of the requested natural resources special permit would cause the loss, diminishment or despoliation of a natural feature designated in § 255-4-15 of this 


§ 255-8-84 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-8-100 
chapter.

Time for obtaining a building permit. A determination from the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be valid for a period of three years from the date on which the Board certifies that all conditions of the determination have been met. The Zoning Board of Appeals may by resolution extend the determination for additional one-year periods. 
§ 255-8-88. Notice required in all cases. 
No waiver of notice. The preceding sections shall not be deemed to waive the requirements of Article IX of this chapter regarding publishing, sign posting or other required notice for variance, special permit or other applications which may be made to the Board of Appeals. Notices in the official newspaper for variances or permits of the type listed in these sections shall state that the application is of a type for which a public hearing may be waived if no written objections are received within the period prescribed in the notice. 
§ 255-8-90. (Reserved) 
§ 255-8-100. Violations. [Amended 9-4-1998 by L.L. No. 30-1998] 
It shall be a violation of this chapter, subject to the provisions of Article X hereof for any person to do any of the following:

D. Violation of conditions of special permit. To violate or fail to comply with a condition or requirement of a special permit issued by the Board of Appeals. 
In addition, for a period of three years from the date of filing of a determination of the Board of Appeals which grants one or more variances or issues a special permit, the Board shall retain jurisdiction and shall have during such period the right to modify, suspend or revoke its determination, in accordance with the standards and procedures for such continuing jurisdiction set forth in § 255-9-25 of this chapter. See also § 255-5-100 hereof.

The following sections shall govern the operation and procedures of those boards charged under this chapter with the duty to receive applications for approvals and to decide the same. This article shall govern applications made for special permits, site plan approvals, architectural and design approvals and variances, all as provided for herein. Applications to the Planning Board for subdivision approval and petitions made to the Town Board for changes to the Use District Map (rezoning of property) shall not be included. 
§ 255-9-21. General. 
A. Procedural rules. Every board may prescribe procedural rules not inconsistent herewith for the conduct of its own affairs, including for the processing of applications, the holding of public hearings, and other matters. 
B. Substantive rules. Every board may by resolution formally adopt substantive rules not inconsistent with any provision of this chapter with regard to applications it is charged with processing and approvals it grants. Where any such rule is made a part of the Town Code by Town Board action, the penalty for a violation of the same shall be as prescribed therein. With regard to other formally adopted rules of boards not explicitly incorporated in the Code, an intentional violation of any such rule by a person with actual knowledge thereof shall constitute a violation of this chapter subject to the provisions of Article X hereof. 
C. Open meetings. All meetings of boards involving matters which are the subject of this chapter shall be open to the public, unless the board shall resolve at such meeting to conduct an executive session for one or more of the purposes authorized in § 105 of the New York State Public Officers Law. Where this chapter incorporates provisions less restrictive with regard to public access than Article 7 of the Public Officers Law, then the provisions of this chapter shall control. 
D. Form of decisions. Every final determination of a board with regard to an application brought before it under provisions of this chapter shall be by formal resolution and shall contain the findings of the board on which it is based. 
E. Imposition of conditions. In making a determination to approve an application in whole or part, every board shall have the power to impose such reasonable conditions and restrictions on its approval as are directly related and incidental to the application. Such conditions or restrictions shall be met in connection with the issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy, or as otherwise specified by the board. [Added 5-15-1998 by L.L. No. 20-1998] 
F. Personal wireless service facility decisions. All decisions resulting in approvals or denials by the Planning Board shall be in writing and supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon competent substantial evidence in the record. [Added 11-1-2002 by L.L. No. 34-2002] 
§ 255-9-22. Initial processing of applications. 
A. Receipt of application. When a board receives from the Building Inspector or from an individual applicant or from another agency, all as provided for in this chapter, an application for an approval over which the board has jurisdiction, it shall immediately stamp the application with the date of such receipt. 
B. Review of applications and determination of completeness. The board shall review each application and determine within 10 days of the receipt thereof whether or not it is complete and ready for processing. No application shall be deemed to be complete and ready for processing unless and until the application is in compliance with this chapter and with the rules of the board regarding the contents of applications. If the application is deemed incomplete or defective for any reason, the applicant shall be promptly notified. Such notification shall include the reason(s) why the application cannot be processed and shall set forth with particularity any additional information which the board requires of the applicant in order to further process the application. The board shall not be required to take any further action on the application, including the scheduling of a public hearing if one is required, until all required forms, materials or information have been submitted. In any case in which the board requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the application shall not be deemed complete for the purposes of any provision of the Town Law or of this chapter imposing time limits upon board action until said environmental impact statement has been prepared, submitted and accepted by the board as complete. [Amended 12-18-1997 by L.L. No. 38-1997; 2-10-1998 by L.L. No. 6-1998]

§ 255-9-22 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-9-23 
Architectural Review Board approval, shall be subject to review pursuant to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and Chapter 75 of this Code, and each board when serving as lead agency shall comply with the procedures thereof. No determination shall be made to approve an application, with or without conditions, until either the board reviewing the same or the lead agency if different shall have issued a negative declaration thereon, pursuant to SEQRA or until such board or agency shall have issued a positive declaration and a draft environmental impact statement shall have been submitted and accepted as complete. [Amended 12-18-1997 by L.L. No. 38-1997] 
D. Method of making completeness determination. The board's determination of completeness in the preceding subsection shall be made only by resolution of the board; provided, however, that the duly adopted rules of a board may provide that this determination shall be delegated in certain or all cases to the board's presiding officer or to the Town Planning Department. 
§ 255-9-23. Notice and hearing. 
A. Setting of hearing; notice. Upon determining that an application is incomplete, the board reviewing the same shall fix a time and place for a public hearing thereon. The public hearing shall be held within 62 days following the board's determination that the application is complete, except that a public hearing on an application before the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be held within a reasonable time after the Board of Appeals has determined the application to be complete, as provided in Town Law § 267-a, Subdivision 7, and as permitted by the Town's municipal home rule powers (superseding Town Law § 274-b, Subdivision 6, to the extent necessary). The board reviewing an application shall provide for the giving of notice at least 10 days prior to the date of the public hearing as follows: [Amended 6-19-1992 by L.L. No. 18-1992; 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996; 12-18-1997 by L.L. No. 38-1997; 2-10-1998 by L.L. No. 6-1998] 
(1) 
By causing a notice giving the time, date, place and nature of the hearing to be published in the official newspaper. 

(2) 
By requiring the applicant to erect a sign measuring not less than two feet long by one foot wide, which shall be prominently displayed on the premises facing each public or private street which the property involved in the application abuts, giving notice of the application, the nature of the approval sought thereby and the time and place of the public hearing thereon. The sign shall be made of durable material, shall be set back not more than 10 feet from the property line, shall be not less than two feet nor more than six feet above the grade at the street line. The sign shall be displayed for a period of not less than 10 days immediately preceding the date of the public hearing or any date to which such hearing may be adjourned. The applicant shall file an affidavit that he has complied with this provision. 

(3) 
By requiring the applicant to send a copy of the public hearing notice to the owners of record of every property which touches or abuts and every property which is directly across any public or private street from, the property involved in the application. This provision shall require that such notice be given to all such owners, including the owners of lands underwater or within another governmental jurisdiction, excepting only the following entities: the State of New York, the County of Suffolk, the Town of East Hampton, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Long Island Rail Road) and the owners of subdivision reserved areas other than 


agricultural reserved areas. (The owners of agricultural reserved areas must receive notice.) Such notice shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, posted at least 10 days prior to the date of the public hearing and addressed to the owners at the latest addresses listed for them in the records of the Town Assessor's office. The applicant shall file with the Board an affidavit that he has complied with this provision, together with the postal receipts evidencing notification of the abutting property owners. 
(4) 
By causing a copy of the complete application to be transmitted to the Suffolk County Planning Commission and the Suffolk County Pine Barrens Review Commission, in cases where such referral of the application is required by the provisions of § 239-m of the New York General Municipal Law, §§ C37-4 and C37-5 of Article XXXVI of the Suffolk County Charter and §§ A14-22 and A14-23 of Article XIV of the Suffolk County Administrative Code, as the same may be from time to time amended. 

(5) 
By causing a copy of the complete application to be transmitted to the owner of every parcel of land located within 500 feet of the property involved in the application, which parcel of land is located in an agricultural district established pursuant to Article 25-AA of the State Agriculture and Markets Law and which contains a farm operation. Such transmittal shall be required in every application for a special permit, site plan approval, or a use variance but shall not be required if the application involves only area variances. See Town Law § 283-a and Agriculture and Markets Law § 305-a. 


B. Exceptions. The provisions of Subsection A hereof shall not apply in the following circumstances, to the extent described herein: [Amended 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996; 2-10-1998 by L.L. No. 6-1998] 
(1) 
This section shall not be deemed to require the Architectural Review Board to hold a public hearing on any application made to it, although the Review Board shall not deny an application without having first afforded the applicant an opportunity to be heard. However, the Review Board may choose to schedule and hold a public hearing on any application made to it if the Board believes that doing so would assist in its review of the application. In any such case, the Board shall give notice of such public hearing as specified in Subsection A hereof and shall require the applicant to comply with the notice provisions of Subsection A(2) and (3). 

(2) 
In the case of the Planning Board and Zoning Board of Appeals, public hearings which are otherwise required hereby may be waived in certain limited instances as provided for in Articles VI and VIII hereof, respectively, and in compliance with any notice requirements provided for in those articles. No complete application for a permit or approval may be finally denied by either board without a hearing, but the waiver of hearing by any board shall not be deemed to abridge in any way the right of such board to modify and approve an application or to approve the application subject to conditions, in the same manner as if a hearing had been held thereon. 

(3) 
Notice shall not be required as set forth in Subsection A hereof for a public hearing which is duly noticed and held but is adjourned or continued to a later date. 

(4) 
On an appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to Article VIII of this chapter, from an interpretation or other decision made by the Building Inspector regarding a particular parcel of property, the applicant ("appellant") shall not be required to 


§ 255-9-23 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-9-26 
comply with the provisions of Subsection A(2) above (i.e., erection of a sign on the property) if he does not own the property and if he has an interest in the outcome of the appeal which is adverse to that of the property owner. In such a case, however, the applicant shall send a copy of the public hearing notice to the property owner, by certified mail, in the same manner in which Subsection A(3) requires that he notify abutting property owners. 
C. Conduct of hearings. Hearings shall be conducted in a fair and open fashion and in accordance with § 101 et seq. of the New York Public Officers Law. Procedures regarding the taking of testimony, swearing in of witnesses, cross-examination and the like shall be as prescribed in the rules of the particular board. 
§ 255-9-24. Post-hearing determination. [Amended 6-19-1992 by L.L. No. 18-1992; 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996] 
The Board shall render a final written determination on an application within 62 days following the close of the public hearing which it has held thereon or, if no hearing is required, within 62 days of the Board's receipt of a complete application, but this time period may be extended if the consent of the applicant is obtained for a longer period of time. 
§ 255-9-25. Continuing jurisdiction. 
Where any provision of this chapter provides for continuing jurisdiction of a board, said board shall, for the period of time stated in the provision, retain the right to modify, suspend or revoke the approval it has given, or any term or condition thereof, or to impose thereon one or more new conditions, all on the following grounds: 
A. False statements. False statements, misrepresentation or mistake of material fact in the application, supporting papers or supporting testimony. 
B. Noncompliance with permit. Failure of the applicant permittee to comply with any conditions or terms of the approval. 
C. Activity beyond permit. Exceeding the scope of the activity use or project as the same was described in the application. 
D. Violation of other local rules. Willful or continuing noncompliance by the applicant with any provision of the Town Code, or local agency regulations adopted thereunder, directly related to the approved activity, use or project. 
Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Building Inspector or other local agency with authority to enforce any provision of this chapter at any time. 
§ 255-9-26. Fees. [Amended 5-1-1992 by L.L. No. 11-1992] 
A. Fees generally. The fees presently charged by the Town for applications for special permits, site plan approvals, architectural and design reviews and variances and for engineering reviews connected with the same are hereby continued. From time to time, the Town Board may by resolution amend one or more of the above fees or institute new fees for other reviews, permits or approvals required of local agencies under this chapter. The Building Inspector shall maintain a current schedule of all such fees and shall make the same available to any member of the public wishing to obtain a copy of the same. 
B. Authority of Town Board. In amending by resolution one or more of the fees referred to in the preceding subsection, or in instituting by resolution new fees as authorized by the preceding subsection, the Town Board may also by resolution do the following: 
(1) 
Set different fees for different types of reviews, permits or approvals, such as a different fee for applications for area variances as opposed to use variances; 

(2) 
Set fees which are cumulative or graduated, or which change depending on some variable in an application for which a fee is imposed; 

(3) 
Set the time or point in an application at which a given fee is payable, such as at the time the application is made; 

(4) 
Set fees for extensions of previously issued permits or approvals, for modifications of such permits or approvals or for the scheduling or rescheduling of public hearings on applications for reviews, permits or approvals; 

(5) 
Provide that one or more fees are nonrefundable; and 

(6) 
Do any other thing which ensures a fair charge or reimbursement for the Town's activities and expenses in processing, reviewing and approving applications made under this chapter. 


C. Completeness of applications. Unless the Town Board has, by resolution, specifically directed that a particular fee be collected only after a local agency approval, no application for a review, permit or approval required under this chapter shall be deemed complete for the purpose of scheduling a public hearing or for the purpose of approval by the local agency reviewing the same until and unless all fees required of such application have been remitted to and collected by the Town. Should the foregoing provision be deemed in any way inconsistent with the timing requirements of § 267 (effective until July 1,1992), § 267-a (effective July 1, 1992) or § 274-a of the New York Town Law, those Town Law provisions are hereby superseded to the extent that they might be construed to require local agency action before the remittance of proper fees. 
D. Validity of approvals; nonwaivability of fees. The failure of the Town or any local agency to collect a fee required under this section shall not be deemed to invalidate an approval issued or granted by the local agency, unless the local agency conditioned its approval upon remittance of the fee and it is not remitted. However, the failure of the Town or any local agency to collect a fee required under this section before the local agency approves an application shall not constitute a waiver of the Town's right to collect said fee. 
E. Fees for personal wireless service facility applications. [Added 11-1-2002 by L.L. No. 34-2002] 
(1) The Town shall have the right to properly plan for and evaluate applications for personal wireless service facilities and to charge reasonable fees for such services to the applicant. Such fees shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(a) Application fee. The Town staff shall evaluate each application on a case-by­case basis. The application fee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the cost 
§ 255-9-26 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-9-30 
for Town staff to properly evaluate applications for personal wireless service facilities. The application fee shall be equally applied to all applications. 
(b) 
Special fee. The Town shall have the right to retain independent technical consultants and experts that it deems necessary to properly evaluate applications for individual personal wireless service facilities. The special fee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the hourly rate of the independent technical consultant or expert the Town deems necessary to properly evaluate applications for personal wireless service facilities. The special fee shall be applied to those applications requiring special review or evaluation. 

(c)

No amendment of this chapter to amend the Use District Map shall be made, except after a public hearing held upon at least 30 days' notice to effected property owners, as provided for in Subsection G hereof.

§ 255-9-30 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-9-32 
Use District Map of Article XII of this chapter is proposed, the Town Clerk shall serve, upon all property owners whose zoning classification on said Map is proposed to be amended, a notice, which notice shall be delivered personally or by mail addressed to the last owner of record of such property at the address set forth in the current official tax roll of the Town of East Hampton, which notice shall be served at least 30 days prior to the date set for the public hearing to consider the proposed amendments(s).

[Added 12-5-2003 by L.L. No. 41-2003235] 
H. Effective date; publication not required. Any amendment of this chapter shall take effect as provided under the Municipal Home Rule Law. To the extent that certain provisions of §§ 264 and 265 of the New York Town Law may be construed to require that, after the adoption of an amendment, the amendment or an abstract or summary thereof be published in a newspaper designated by the Town and that an affidavit of publication be filed with the Town Clerk, those provisions of Town Law §§ 264 and 265 are superseded pursuant to the Town's powers under Article 9, § 2(b)(3) of the New York State Constitution; § 10, Subdivision 6, of the Statute of Local Governments; and § 10, Subdivision 1(ii)a(3), (11) and (14), of the Municipal Home Rule Law. 
§ 255-9-32. Protest petitions. [Added 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996] 
New York Town Law § 265 imposes a supermajority voting requirement upon the Town Board in its adoption or amendment of zoning regulations, when the adoption or amendment of those regulations has been the subject of a protest petition filed by certain property owners. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 265 of the Town Law, in cases in which such protest petitions have been filed the amendment of this chapter shall be governed by the provisions of this section, which shall supersede the application of Town Law § 265 in its application to such amendments. 
A. Purpose. As was formerly stated in Chapter 16 of this Town Code (repealed simultaneously with the adoption of this section), the health, safety and welfare of the community cannot be adequately protected by the Town Board unless it can speedily effect changes of land use regulations when the need for such action is clearly shown. The supermajority vote provisions of § 265 of the Town Law have in the past proven to be detrimental to the Town by impairing the Town Board's ability to speedily enact needed changes in the Town's zoning and land use regulations, even when such changes have been desired by the overwhelming majority of Town residents and by a majority of their elected representatives, with the result that sound planning has been undermined and the will of the electorate thwarted. For this reason, the Town Board on January 13, 1984, enacted Local Law No. 3-1984, which employed the powers granted the Town in the State Constitution, Statute of Local Governments and Municipal Home Rule Law to remedy this situation and supersede the pertinent provisions of Town Law § 265, as they then existed. It is the intent 
235.Editor's Note: This local law also provided for the renumbering of former Subsection G as Subsection H. 
of this section to continue such supersession power in respect to changes or amendments of this chapter. 
B. Supermajority vote of Town Board not required. The Town Board may amend this chapter and may adopt, amend, change, modify or repeal any land use regulation, restriction, zoning (use) district classification or zoning district boundary contained herein or to be included herein by adoption of a local law as set forth in § 255-9-30 hereof, and such local law shall be deemed to have been approved and adopted by a favorable vote of a simple majority of the entire Town Board and shall then take full force and effect as provided for in the laws of the State of New York, regardless of whether or not the amendment, change, modification or other action has been the subject of a written protest presented to the Town and signed by: 
(1) 
The owners of 20% or more of the area of land included in such proposed change; or 

(2) 
The owners of 20% or more of the area of land immediately adjacent to that land included in such proposed change, extending 100 feet therefrom; or 

(3) 
The owners of 20% or more of the area of land directly opposite thereto, extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite land. 


C. Town Law superseded. This section shall be deemed to supersede and amend, in its application to the Town of East Hampton, those portions of Subdivision 1 of Town Law § 265 which require an affirmative vote of 3/4 of the members of the Town Board to adopt a change or amendment to this chapter which change or amendment is the subject of a protest petition as set forth in said Subdivision 1 of Town Law § 265. Such supersession is accomplished pursuant to the Town's powers under Article 9, § 2(b)(3), of the New York State Constitution; § 10, Subdivision 6, of the Statute of Local Governments; and § 10, Subdivision 1(ii)a(3), (11) and (14), of the Municipal Home Rule Law. 
§ 255-9-35. Effect of amendments. 
A. Completion of buildings or structures for which building permits have been issued. Where a lawful building permit has been granted for the construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or structure, and said permit has not expired, no amendment to any provision of this chapter shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction or use of such building or structure, provided that: 
(1) 
The construction of such building or structure shall have been begun and been diligently prosecuted prior to the effective date of the amendment in question; and 

(2) 
The entire building or structure shall be completed within one year after the effective date of the amendment and according to the filed and approved plans upon which the building permit was based. 


B. Development of approved subdivision plats. Plats which have been duly approved and properly filed with the office of the Clerk of Suffolk County shall be exempt from amendments to this chapter which increase minimum lot areas or dimensions for the time period provided for in § 265-a of the Town Law. All other subdivisions shall not be so exempt. [Amended 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996]

§ 255-11-30. Berms, fences and walls. [Amended 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996] 
§ 255-11-31. Purpose. 
With the recent rapid growth of the Town has come a proliferation of high berms, fences and walls, especially in residential areas. While these structures often provide a means for the property owner on which they are located to achieve privacy, the benefits achieved are often outweighed by the public harm done: 
A. Setbacks. Siting of massive or opaque structures close to property lines and roads defeats the light-and-air bases for required yard setbacks imposed upon other structures. 
B. Historic and rural character. The presence of such structures diminishes the visual attributes of the Town by obscuring long vistas and views of natural and man-made features basic to the Town's character, including historic buildings set close to roads, and by creating a walled-in urban look. 
C. Safety. By destroying sight lines and eliminating open areas alongside streets and highways, such structures can make in-tersections more dangerous, increase the hazard to pedestrians and animals and create blind driveways wherever they appear. 
In addition, where legitimate needs for privacy exist, due to proximity to streets or other dwellings for example, it can usually be achieved with hedges, shrubs or other living fences carrying little of the negative impacts set forth above. It is thus prudent to place restrictions on the size and location of berms, fences and walls and to subject certain of the same to a reasonable level of review and scrutiny by local agencies in order to ameliorate the effect which they would otherwise produce, individually and collectively, on the Town. 
§ 255-11-34. Berms. 
The following regulations shall apply to all berms in all districts unless otherwise indicated: 
A. Building permits. The erection, enlargement, alteration or removal of the following types of berms shall require a building permit. 
(1) 
A berm greater than four feet in height and located within the required front yard area of any lot in any district, other than a Central Business District; or 

(2) 
A berm over six feet in height, in any location. 


B. Architectural review. Architectural and design review shall be required for any berm for which a building permit is required. 
C. Contents of applications. Building permit applications for berms shall include the following: 
(1) 
A detailed grading plan of the entire site indicating the existing topography in contour intervals no greater than five feet and the proposed topography in contour intervals no greater than two feet. The scale of such grading plan shall be no greater than one inch equals 20 feet. 

(2) 
A cross section of the berm indicating the type of materials to be used in constructing the same (i.e., fill, topsoil, etc.) and the location of the landscaping. The scale of such cross section shall be no greater than one inch equals four feet. 

(3) 
A detailed landscaping plan indicating the location, size and quantity of the species to be planted. 


D. Referral of applications. The Building Inspector shall refer all applications for a building permit for a berm to the Architectural Review Board for its approval with respect to the compatibility of the berm with the surrounding properties, streets and associated land uses, drainage and appearance. At the same time, if the building of such berm, or the activity or work of which such construction is a part, is itself subject to site plan review pursuant to Article VI hereof, the Inspector shall also refer the application to the Planning Board for its review. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to eliminate the need to obtain any other permit or local agency approval applicable to the building of the berm or to the activity or work of which it is a part. 
E. Review. Unless its review is in conjunction with site plan review by the Planning Board, the Architectural Review Board shall, within 30 working days after receipt of a complete application, approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the application. In making its determination, the Board shall consider, among other things, the findings set forth in § 255-11-31 hereof. The Building Inspector shall not issue a building permit for a berm until Architectural Review Board approval has been received. Failure of the Board to act within 30 working days shall be deemed an approval. 
F. General rules. The following regulations apply to all berms, whether or not a building permit is required therefor. 
(1) 
Berms shall be constructed only during the period from March 1 to October 15. Only clean fill, topsoil or an approved equivalent shall be used. Material shall be given sufficient time to settle before final shaping and topsoil are applied. After shaping, a uniform layer at least six inches thick of approved horticultural topsoil shall be placed and fine graded. 

(2) 
Berms shall be located only in the position on a lot approved by the Architectural Review Board, if review by the Board is required by this section. In no case shall all or part of any berm be placed upon street rights-of-way or other public property. 

(3) 
Berms shall not exceed eight feet in height, but upon a written finding of exceptional circumstances related to high levels of ambient noise or light which cannot be abated and from which protection is needed or public interest considerations, berms of up to 10 feet in height may be authorized. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no berm located on a residential property in a yard fronting on a public street shall exceed six feet in height, and no berm, wherever located, shall violate the setback limitations of 


§ 255-11-34 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-11-38 
§ 255-11-72D, Pyramid law, or § 255-11-74A or B, setbacks from scenic easements and setbacks on corner lots hereof. The height of a berm shall be the vertical distance from any point on the top of the berm (exclusive of plantings) to the existing natural grade at the base of the berm at that point. 
(4) 
No fence, gate, pillar or wall shall be constructed on a berm, and no berm shall interfere with existing natural drainage patterns or cause ponding or flooding on any property. [Amended 12-17-2020 by L.L. No. 10-2020] 

(5) 
Berms shall be properly vegetated and landscaped, in the manner approved by the Architectural Review Board, if applicable, before any erosion occurs in the topsoil on the berm, or, in the alternative, the berm shall be covered with an approved ground cover until such time as the berm can be properly landscaped. 


§ 255-11-36. (Reserved)239 
§ 255-11-38. Fences and walls. [Amended 6-14-2001 by L.L. No. 11-2001; 5-21-2015 by L.L. No. 12-2015] 
A. Building permits and Architectural and Design Board review. The erection, enlargement, alteration or removal of the following types of fences, gates, pillars and walls shall require a building permit and Architectural and Design Board review and approval: 
(1) 
A fence, gate, pillar or wall greater than four feet in height and located within the required front yard area of any lot; 

(2) 
A fence, gate, pillar or wall over six feet in height, in any location; 

(3) 
Any fence, gate, pillar or wall for which site plan approval is required. 


B. Architectural and Design Board review and approval shall not be required for fences and corresponding gates that are in compliance with all other requirements of this chapter and meet all of the following criteria: 
(1) 
The fence is constructed of either minimum two-inch-square black or green_wire field fencing between six feet and eight feet in height or black or green wire farm and field agricultural fencing subject to the height limitation of six feet for a fence or gate located on a residential property in a yard fronting (bordering upon) a public street unless it is located 50 feet or more from the edge of the pavement of the public street; and 

(2) 
The fence posts are made of two-inch-maximum black or green metal poles; and 

(3) 
The area enclosed by the fence is less than 50% of the area of the parcel; and 

(4) 
The fence will be installed along only two property lines and is more than 20 feet away from running along the remaining property lines; and 

(5)

(6) 
The gate is a corresponding structure to a fence that meets all the requirements of 


239.Editor's Note: Former § 255-11-36, Fences, was repealed 6-14-2001 by L.L. No. 11-2001. See now § 255-11-38, Fencesand Walls. 
Downloaded from https://ecode360.com/EA0658 on 2023-11-07 
paragraphs (1)-(5) above as well as all of the following: the gate is constructed of metal or wood framing and either minimum two-inch-square black or green wire field fencing or black or green wire farm and field agricultural fencing; the gate is no more than six feet in height on a residential property in a yard that fronts (borders upon) a public street or otherwise no more than eight feet in height; and if the gate traverses a driveway, that it is placed no closer than 20 feet to the edge of the public or private road surface. 
The provisions of § 255-11-34D and E regarding review of berms shall apply to such walls, gates and fences. 
C. Height limits. 
(1) 
The height of a fence, gate, pillar, post or wall shall be the vertical distance from any point on the top of the fence, gate, pillar, post or wall (exclusive of plantings) to the existing natural grade at the base of the fence, gate, pillar, post or wall at that point. A fence located on the top of a wall shall for all purposes be deemed to be part of the wall. The height of a fence, gate, pillar, post or wall shall be subject to the provisions of § 255-10-40C. 

(2) 
Fences, gates, pillars, posts and walls shall not exceed eight feet in height when located in yards that do not front (border upon) a public street and shall not exceed six feet in height when located in yards that front (border upon) a public street. The Architectural Review Board has the discretion to vary from these height limitations in certain circumstances: 

(i) 
Upon a written finding by the Architectural Review Board of exceptional circumstances related to high levels of ambient noise, light, or property damage from animals which cannot be abated by the landowner and from which protection is needed, or of public interest considerations, fences and walls of up to 10 feet in height may be authorized; or 

(ii) 
On a residential property in a yard fronting (bordering) on a public street, if the fence, gate, pillar, post and/or wall is to be located 50 feet or more from the edge of the pavement of the public street, such fence, gate, pillar, post and/or wall of up to eight feet in height may be authorized; or 




(iii) Upon a written finding by the Architectural Review Board for an application for a fence, constructed of field agricultural fencing, that is for property on which agriculture is a principal use pursuant to the requirements of § 255-11-88, and that the fence will enclose only the area of the property used as part of a bona fide agricultural operation; and that the fence will be set back at least 10 feet from the property line or the edge of the pavement of the public street (whichever is farther); such fence of up to eight feet in height may be authorized, and if found by the Board to be necessary, in addition a tension wire placed above such fence at a height not to exceed nine feet from the existing natural grade may also be approved. Such approval is also upon condition that if either of the conditions upon which the Board made such findings should change, that the fence (and wire) must be reduced to a total of six feet in height, within 30 days. 
D. Setbacks for fences, gates, pillars and walls. No wall, gate, pillar or fence for which a 
§ 255-11-38 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-11-42 
building permit is required by this section, wherever located, shall violate the setback limitations of § 255-11-74A and B (setbacks from scenic easements and setbacks on corner lots), but fences, gates, pillars and walls need not comply with § 255-11-72D, Pyramid law. Gates must comply with the provisions of § 255-11-88 (Driveways, Gates, Pillars and Other Obstructions). 
§ 255-11-39. Site plan review unaffected. 
Nothing in § 255-11-34, 255-11-36 or 255-11-38 hereof shall be deemed to interfere with or abridge any provision of Article VI of this chapter requiring site plan approval for certain structures, lots or uses, including any such provision which may require site plan approval for every structure on a particular lot or site. 
§ 255-11-40. Parking requirements. 
In order to minimize traffic congestion, air pollution and the risk of motor vehicle and pedestrian accidents, as well as to promote other elements of sound community planning, off-street parking and truck loading spaces shall be provided and kept available as an accessory use to all permitted and special permit uses of buildings, structures and lots in numbers not less than those set forth in the following sections. 
§ 255-11-42. Method of determining requirements. 
A. Single use. The requirement for a single use (e.g., a single-family residence or a retail store) shall be determined directly from the Schedule of Parking Requirements in § 255-11-45. 
B. Combination use. The requirement for a combination use made up of two or more component uses (e.g., a bowling alley combined with an auditorium, a restaurant with a bar or a retail store with an office building) shall be determined by establishing the requirement for each component use from the schedule and adding them together. 
C. Fractions. When the required number of spaces is determined to result in a fraction, the number shall be increased to the next higher whole number. 
D. Unlisted use. If the use in question is not specifically listed in the schedule, the requirement shall be that of the most similar listed use. 
E. Number of employees. When the schedule requires the number of spaces to be calculated per employee, and employees are on the site in shifts, the number to be used is the number of employees present during the largest shift. 
F. Garages and carports. Garages and carports and, only in the case of residences, driveways, may be used to meet parking requirements of these sections, but no garage or other parking area shall be located under a motel, multiple residence (other than a two-family dwelling) or resort without the explicit written permission of the Fire Prevention Inspector, as well as of every other local agency having jurisdiction to review and approve such a plan. 
G. Adjacent property. Parking requirements of these sections may be satisfied for a single or combination use on an adjacent or neighboring property within 500 feet of the use in question; provided, however, that any approval of such a configuration by a local agency shall be conditioned on the grant of a permanent parking easement over the subordinate property and in favor of the dominant property, with such assurances (including title reports) as the local agency may find necessary to ensure the continued availability of parking on the subordinate property. [Amended 7-2-1999 by L.L. No. 16-1999] 
H. Special permit uses. Uses requiring a special permit pursuant to Article V of this chapter may be required by the local agency having jurisdiction to create up to 150% of the minimum parking required in these sections if it is found, either because of the nature of the use, the nature of the site or for some other reason, that such additional parking would be necessary for the use to comply with any of the standards or safeguards of Article V applicable to it. 
I. Storage buildings. The amount and type of parking required for storage buildings may be determined by the local agency having jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis according to the nature of the entire use of which the building is a part. [Amended 8-16-1985 by L.L. No. 8-1985] 
J. Limited Business Overlay uses. The Planning Board must approve a plan illustrating the number of spaces required by § 255-11-45 but may permit the construction of less than the number of parking spaces required for any use proposed within the Limited Business Overlay District upon a finding that the circumstances of the immediately proposed use does not require the maximum number of spaces required by § 255-11-45. Any future change in the parking on that particular site may be constructed with a building permit pursuant to the approved plan without additional Planning Board approval. [Added 10-6-2006 by L.L. No. 24-2006] 
§ 255-11-43. Design requirements of off-street accessory parking and truck loading areas. 
A. Site plan approval required. For all properties and uses subject to site plan review pursuant to Article VI, new accessory off-street parking and truck loading areas shall be located and established only as the same are indicated on a site plan duly approved by the Planning Board. 
B. Physical improvements. The physical improvements of off-street parking and truck loading areas shall include: 
(1) 
Curbs, paving, sidewalks and drainage facilities complying with the standards established in this Code or the regulations of the Planning Board. 

(2) 
Lighting of public parking areas adequate to assure general safety and convenience, while at the same time of such design as to avoid having light sources be visible from the street or across property lines. 

(3) 
Screening appropriate to the protection of adjacent properties from automotive noise, fumes and visual impact. 


C. Aisles. Unless a different configuration shall be approved by the Planning Board during site plan review for reasons of sound planning and proper site layout, all aisles within parking areas shall have a minimum width of 24 feet when the parking spaces are at a ninety-degree angle with the aisle, 18 feet when the parking spaces are at a sixty-degree angle in a one-way direction with the aisle and 12 feet when the parking spaces are at a forty-five degree angle in a on-way direction with the aisle. [Amended 3-15-1991 by L.L. No. 4-1991] 
§ 255-11-43 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-11-45 
D. Circulation. Aisles and turning areas shall provide good internal circulation with adequate radii to assure ease of mobility, ample clearance and convenient access and egress. 
E. Gradients. Center-line gradients of aisles shall not exceed 8%. 
F. Size of parking spaces. Parking spaces shall be marked off with a minimum width of 10 feet and a minimum length of 18 feet, or a minimum width of nine feet and a minimum length of 20 feet. In the case of parking spaces for trucks or special equipment, parking spaces shall be of a minimum size to be determined by the Planning Board based upon the nature of the parked vehicles.

§ 255-11-46. Waivers. 
A. Seasonal use. The Planning Board, in the case of a use which traditionally exhibits extended periods of low parking demand, may allow up to 75% of the required parking for horse farms or, for all other uses, up to 50% of the required parking to be located on prepared, well-drained, dust free grassed areas, so as to lessen the amount of improved parking required. In determining whether to allow the use of such grass parking, the Planning Board shall consider the availability of on-street public parking in the vicinity of the project site, historic use patterns of the site, and the character of the surrounding area. [Amended 5-3-2002 by L.L. No. 10-2002; 6-3-2005 by L.L. No. 14-2005] 
B. Central business districts.

However, no such fees shall be collected until the Planning Board shall have adopted regulations governing computation of the fee and use of the same. 
C. Historic Districts. The Planning Board, in the case of a use located on lots within Town-designated Historic Districts, may waive all or a portion of the parking required by the Table of Off-Street Parking Requirements pursuant to a written finding made by Planning Board resolution that: [Added 6-4-2004 by L.L. No. 11-2004] 
(1) 
The lot proposed for an alternative use requiring site plan and/or special permit approval is suitable for such alternative use and/or development; and 

(2) 
The proposed use of the property is consistent with preserving the historical attributes of the site; and 

(3) 
Existing on-site and or nearby on-street or municipal parking can accommodate the 


§ 255-11-46 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-11-52 
projected demand from the proposed use; and 
(4) The provision of some or all of the required off-street parking on the parcel would have a detrimental impact on the historical attributes of the subject property, including its historical context, setting and historical value.

§ 255-11-60. Single-family residence regulations. 
§ 255-11-61. Purpose. 
An important function of local land use regulation is the establishment and protection of single-family residential districts in which tranquil, healthy and safe neighborhood environments are maintained for the quiet enjoyment of resident homeowners and their families and in which the children of such families may be properly raised. Such residential areas provide a setting suitable primarily for the Town's permanent and seasonal residents who are living, working, going to school, paying taxes, etc., in East Hampton. The needs of transients, on the other hand, are best accommodated in other districts. Nearly any business enterprise conducted for the purpose of making a profit may sacrifice other values critical to residential neighborhoods. Thus, the courts have long recognized the right of municipalities to entirely segregate business uses from such districts and to otherwise prevent unwarranted commercialization from encroaching therein, including that commercialization caused by the misuse of single-family residences. In particular, the purely commercial use of such structures by absentee owners poses problems for adjacent properties and residents, as well as to legitimate businesses located in commercial district paying business taxes, and must be strictly limited. The regulations in these sections and throughout this chapter recognize these principals and are designed to further the same, while at the same time permitting certain compatible activities in single-family residences which can serve to supplement an owner's income without risking harm to surrounding residences or entire residential neighborhoods. 
§ 255-11-62. Uses permitted in single-family residences. [Amended 5-4-2007 by L.L. No. 18-2007] 
The following are the only uses permitted in single-family residences in the Town of East Hampton: 
A. Principal residence. Permanent, seasonal or intermittent occupation by the owner's family as principal residence. 
B. Nonprincipal residence. Temporary, seasonal or intermittent occupancy by the owner's family as nonprincipal residence, vacation residence or second home. 
C. Supplemental uses when owner or owner's family in residence. During periods of actual occupancy by one or more members of the owner's family: 
(1) 
Use of one home office. 

(2) 
Engaging in home occupations. 

(3) 
Rental of one or two guest rooms. 

(4) 
Rental of an affordable accessory apartment pursuant to § 255-11-63. 


§ 255-11-62 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-11-63 
(5) 
Operation of a residential museum as defined in this chapter. [Added 7-1-2010 by L.L. No. 6-2010] 

(6) 
Use of a small taxi office (office use, nondispatch). A small taxi office (office use, nondispatch) shall be limited to a business owned and operated by the owner of a parcel of real property that operates either one of two taxicabs or vehicles for hire under a single business license issued pursuant to Chapter 226 of this Code, provided that there is: [Added 5-15-2014 by L.L. No. 11-2014] 

(a) 
No dispatching of taxicabs from the premises where the small taxi office is located; and 

(b)

(c) 
Sufficient, delineated parking areas on the subject parcel to provide for parking of four motor vehicles. Street parking of taxi cabs or vehicles for hire at or near the small taxi office location is prohibited. 

(d) 
Only one small taxi office (office use, nondispatch) per parcel of real property. 




D. Supplemental use when owner and owner's family not in residence. During periods of nonoccupancy by all persons in the owner's family, and subject to the provisions of § 255-11-64 hereof, occupancy of the entire residence by one family as guest of owner or as tenant. In the case of such occupancy, the supplemental uses set forth in Subsection C(1), 
(2) and (5) of this section may be engaged in by a resident tenant, but the uses in Subsection C(3) and (4) thereof shall be prohibited. Where there is occupancy of the entire residence by one family as guest or tenant of the owner, the supplemental uses provided for in Subsection C(6) may be engaged in by a resident tenant or guest only where such resident or guest can provide proof of leasing a premises in the Town of East Hampton for at least one year prior to application for the supplemental use and that he or she is the owner and operator of the business that operates out of the small taxi office. [Amended 7-1-2010 by

(3) 
An affordable accessory apartment shall not be permitted on a lot on which there exists an artist studio, rooming house or boarders, home occupation, home professional office, preexisting accessory apartment, two-family detached dwelling or multiple-family dwelling.

accessory apartment may not also rent guest rooms pursuant to § 255-11-62C(3). 
(4) 
An affordable apartment may not be sublet. 

(5) 
No affordable accessory apartment shall be permitted if the result would be a residential density of more than two dwelling units per lot. 

(6)

§ 255-11-71. Interpretation of setbacks. [Amended 12-17-2020 by L.L. No. 10-2020] 
In order to avoid undue crowding and the loss of open space, vegetated areas, rural community character and privacy, the Dimensional Table of § 255-11-10 establishes required setbacks for all buildings and structures on lots. However, no provision of this chapter shall be construed to prohibit in required yard (setback) areas of any lot such paved driveways or walkways as may be necessary to connect on-site parking areas, garages or building entrances to the street. Further, no such provision shall be deemed to prohibit the location in required yards of otherwise lawful berms, fences, gates, pillars, walls, signs, landscaping, plantings, turf or sod or to prohibit the otherwise lawful parking or storage of cars and boats in required yards. 
§ 255-11-72. Height. 
A. Determination of height. The height of any point on a building or structure shall be the vertical distance from such point to the natural ground elevation directly beneath the point whose height is being measured. The height of a building or structure shall be the height of the highest point thereof. 
B. Limitation on maximum height. Except as provided for in Subsections C and E of this section, no part of any building or structure shall exceed the maximum height permitted for the same by the Dimensional Table. 
C. Gabled roof. Where such Dimensional Table lists a height for a gabled roof greater than the figure listed as the otherwise permitted maximum height of the building, the peak of such gabled roof may have a height up to, but no greater than, the higher figure listed. Only such gabled roof, and those parts of the building covered or directly overlain by it, shall be at levels higher than the applicable maximum height listed in the table, and no other point on the building shall exceed such ordinary maximum height. Further, the highest plate or bearing point for rafters at the eaves shall not exceed such listed maximum height.

(3) 
A residential building or structure with a gabled roof having a maximum height at the peak of up to 35 feet may be permitted by the approval of the Architectural Review Board only if: 

(a) 
The proposed residence having such a height at the peak fully meets the standards and criteria set forth in § 255-7-60 of this chapter and is consonant with the purposes set forth in § 255-7-10.

(d) 
The owner covenants that the parcel upon which the building or structure utilizing the greater height allowance of this subsection is built will not be the subject of any future subdivision or lot line modification which would defeat the lot area or setback requirements of Subsection E(3)(b) and (c) above. 

(4) 
The height limitations listed in the Dimensional Table of § 255-11-10 shall not be deemed to apply to the installation of solar panels provided they are installed in compliance with the requirements of Chapter 102, Building Construction, Article III, Solar Installations, § 102-30, Fast-track permits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for installations on flat roofs, the provisions of § 102-30A(3) shall not apply to such installation, provided the other provisions of § 102-30, Fast-track permits, are complied with. Installations on flat-roofed structures may extend beyond the applicable height limits for the structure, provided that the maximum height of installed panels shall not exceed 10 inches beyond the roof surface, if such additional height is required for panel installation. In no instance shall the height of the panels violate the provisions of Subsection D of this section (§ 255-11-72D, Pyramid law). [Added 11-18-2021 by L.L. No. 22-2021] 




§ 255-11-74. Other setbacks and height restrictions.

[Amended 11-15-1996 by L.L. No. 19-1996; 12-17-2020 by L.L. No. 10-2020] 
C. Rear lots on streets. When a rear lot line is also a street right-of-way line, the required rear yard setback for an accessory building or structure shall be double the required rear yard setback in the applicable district. 
D. Setback in Central Business Districts. [Added 7-16-2015 by L.L. No. 26-2015] 
(1) 
As part of a site plan application, pursuant to Article VI herein, the Planning Board may require new or reconstructed buildings located in the Central Business District to have a setback of up to 20 feet where the Board finds any of the following:

The minimum frontage of any lot on a public street and the minimum access width of any lot shall be 20 feet. If frontage is provided by means of a flag strip, access width shall be measured perpendicular to the sides of the flag strip. Notwithstanding this requirement, the Planning Board may approve the creation of a new lot not having such frontage, by subdivision waiver or by open space subdivision after the effective date hereof, if the new lot will have access to a public street by means of a common driveway easement or access easement which is 20 feet or more in width at all points and which easement is the subject of a duly recorded legal instrument which cannot be revoked or terminated without Planning Board approval. To the extent that § 280-a of the New York Town Law requires that a lot directly abut a street and have a minimum frontage of 15 feet thereon, § 280-a is superseded in order to allow access by easement as just described, pursuant to the Town's powers under Article 9, § 2(b)(3) of the New York State Constitution; § 10, Subdivision 6 of the Statute of Local Governments; and § 10, Subdivision 1(ii)a(3), (11) and (14), of the Municipal Home Rule Law.

An artist's studio, as defined in § 255-1-20, shall not contain more than one story, but may be situated above a garage or other conforming accessory structure, and shall not have a gross floor area greater than that of a legally permitted accessory structure, except, based upon a finding by the Planning Board that an artist's studio exceeding such limitation is justified for the scope or size of the work engaged in by the artist, and is otherwise compatible with the residential neighborhood in which it is located, in which case, no such artist's studio shall in any case exceed the lesser of: 

(a) 
The gross floor area of the ground floor of the residence;

(a) Reviewed and approved an application filed by the property owner which the Town Planning Board has determined meets the criteria for an Artist's Studio, and, if such studio is proposed in excess of the applicable accessory structure size limitations contained in the Town Zoning Code, the applicant's art form and property constraints combine to make it difficult or impractical to construct studio space that is attached to the principal building or to construct an accessory structure that complies with the Town Zoning Code, in which case the Planning Board may allow a square footage in excess of that for an accessory structure; however, in no event shall such Artist's Studio exceed the limitations set forth in this § 255-11-88, "Artist's Studio". Attention is also called to the definition of "Fine Arts" set forth in § 255-1-20, "Definitions," of the Town Code.

(1) OUTDOOR DINING AT RESTAURANTS  
(a) Outdoor dining at restaurants pursuant to site plan review. Outdoor dining may be allowed at a legally existing restaurant by site plan review pursuant to § 255-6-30B. In such case outdoor dining need not be limited to 30% of the approved indoor seating but is limited by the property owner's compliance with any increases in 
§ 255-11-88 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-11-88 
site parking requirements which are necessitated by the additional seating, by total coverage limitations or setback requirements applicable to the outdoor dining area, or by the requirement for approval of the wastewater disposal system by the Suffolk County Department of Health Services. When approval for outdoor dining is allowed pursuant to site plan review, reduction of indoor dining is not necessarily required, but a seating plan for both indoor and outdoor seating must be filed with the Planning Board. Outdoor dining, as a use, is limited to the service of restaurant food and beverages incidental to the service of food. 
(b) 
Outdoor dining at restaurants with Fire Marshal approval. The Fire Marshal may approve the transfer of up to 30% of a restaurants indoor dining capacity to an outdoor dining area under this Subdivision (2). The Fire Marshal may only approve outdoor dining for restaurants that are legally existing. Outdoor dining, as a use, is limited to the service of restaurant food and beverages incidental to the service of food. Outdoor dining is allowed by permission of the Fire Marshal without additional site plan review only if the following conditions are met: 

[1] Outdoor seating is limited to 30% of the approved indoor seating capacity (number of seats), with the indoor seating capacity reduced by the outdoor seating so that the total approved seating remains the seating capacity allowed by the site plan or, if no site plan exists, the seating capacity determined by the Fire Marshal as part of the restaurants place of assembly permit pursuant to § 141-9D(19). 
[2] A seating plan for both indoor and outdoor seating must be filed with the Fire Marshal as part of the restaurants place of assembly permit pursuant to § 141­9D(19), and the Fire Marshal must approve the location of the outdoor seating as consistent with health and safety concerns addressed in the Town Code as well as the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code as defined by New York State Codes, Rules and Regulations Title 19, Section 1219.1. 

(c) 
Outdoor dining at restaurants with Planning Department approval, as a pilot program (transfer of outdoor dining area administrative permit). 


[1] General rules. Restaurants may transfer some or all of their legally existing indoor dining area to outdoor space, in accordance with a renewable annual administrative permit issued by the Planning Department (hereinafter, Department) pursuant to this subdivision. This permit shall be known as the transfer of outdoor dining area administrative permit. As allowed hereunder, outdoor dining is limited only to tables and chairs for the service of restaurant food and beverages incidental to the service of food, and for passageway between those tables and chairs. Structural improvements shall be limited to relatively removable improvements such as gravel, flagstone, or other ground surfacing materials which do not have concrete footings. 
[2] Procedure. The Planning Department shall be responsible for the issuance of a renewable transfer of outdoor dining area administrative permit upon application made to the Department on the appropriate form. 
[a] The proposed outdoor dining area shall be clearly depicted on a survey or site plan (based on a survey) such that the boundaries of the outdoor dining area can be clearly delineated and such that all other features (e.g., 
[3] 
[4] 
GENERAL PROVISIONS § 255-11-88 
landscaping) are properly and clearly shown and/or described. Seating plans shall be consistent with approved occupancy limits, shall indicate required egress, and shall be clearly marked or labeled as to the circumstances under which such plan will be utilized. 
[b] There shall be no reduction or displacement of off-street parking required for the existing restaurant use. 
[c] Health and safety. The Department shall consult with the Fire Marshal for confirmation that the applicants proposed outdoor seating area meets Town, county, and state health and safety requirements as well as the requirements of the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code as defined by New York State Codes, Rules and Regulations Title 19, Section 1219.1 or any successor regulation. 
[d] Lighting. An applicant for a transfer of outdoor dining area administrative permit shall also submit to the Planning Department an application for administrative lighting permit under § 255-1-84 of this chapter. The Department shall review the applicants application and lighting plan in order to ensure that they comply with the provisions of § 255-1-80, et seq., of the Town Code. A noncompliant lighting plan shall be grounds for disapproving the requested transfer of dining area permit. 
[e] Building permit. A building permit shall be issued prior to implementation of an approved transfer of indoor restaurant seating to an outdoor dining area. 
Nature of permit. The transfer of outdoor dining area permit issued pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed an administrative permit, temporary in nature, in which no permanent or vested rights accrue to the applicant. This permit must be renewed annually, upon application for renewal submitted to the Planning Department. For so long as this permit process is authorized in the Town Code, the Planning Department shall grant each annual renewal request unless the applicant has failed to meet one or more conditions of the original approval or a prior renewal. 
[a] 
Expiration of permit. Upon the expiration of an administrative permit issued pursuant to this subsection, or the cancellation of this permit process by amendment to the Town Code, an applicant can only retain any changes made to its restaurant use hereunder by applying for and obtaining site plan approval from the Planning Board pursuant to Article XI hereof. This pilot program shall expire December 31, 2024, unless extended by the Town Board. 

Standards of review. The transfer of indoor dining area at restaurants to on-premises outdoor space is allowed by administrative permit under this Subdivision (3), and without the necessity of site plan review under Article VI hereof, only if the following conditions and requirements are met: 

[a] 
Limitation of use to dining. 


[a] Only indoor restaurant dining area, which is that existing space used 
§ 255-11-88 
[5] 
[6] 
EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-11-88 
for serving food and incidental beverages to seated patrons, may be transferred to outdoor space pursuant to this subdivision. 
[b] No outdoor food preparation is permitted in the outdoor space. 
[c] No bar use is permitted in the outdoor space. 
[d] No new use may be introduced into the previously utilized indoor space without site plan approval, although vacated space may be used to facilitate take-out food service. 
[e] No features or conditions of a previously approved site plan, such as required landscaping or designated parking areas, may be removed, changed, or altered to create new outdoor dining space under this subsection. Only conversions of outdoor space to dining use that are not in conflict with an approved site plan for the property or, if a preexisting restaurant use, with the historic preexisting use as determined by the Building Inspector, may be made without site plan approval pursuant to Article VI of this chapter. 
Occupancy that may be transferred. 
[a] The transfer of indoor restaurant dining area to an outdoor space pursuant to this subdivision may be seasonal or weather-related. 
[b] The combined occupancy of patrons, indoor and outdoor, may not exceed 100% of the preexisting approved indoor seating capacity (number of seats) without site plan review pursuant to Article VI hereof. Approved indoor seating capacity is determined by site plan or, if no site plan exists, by the seating capacity, for indoor dining, and not bar use, as determined by the Fire Marshal. 
[c] In the following zoning or zoning overlay districts the maximum percentage of approved indoor seating capacity that may be transferred from indoors to outdoors is 100%: Central Business, Waterfront, Recreational Overlay, Resort, Commercial Industrial and Commercial Service. In all other zoning or zoning overlay districts, the maximum percentage of approved indoor seating capacity that may be transferred from indoors to outdoors is 75%: Neighborhood Business, and Limited Business Overlay. 
[d] Notwithstanding the foregoing, restaurants which are preexisting nonconforming uses in a residential use district are not eligible for the issuance of a transfer of outdoor dining area administrative permit hereunder. 
Location and configuration of outdoor dining space. 
[a] The outdoor dining area utilized under this Subdivision (3) may be on the same property as is occupied by the legal restaurant use, or, if the restaurant is permitted or specially permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, and if the adjoining property also permits or specially permits a restaurant use, it may be on adjoining private property owned by a 
[7] 
[8] 
different person (e.g., an adjoining alleyway) and which private property is situated in a use district where restaurants are a permitted or specially permitted use, or it may be on property within an East Hampton Town or New York State road right-of-way. However, if the outdoor dining space will not be on the applicants property, the applicant must furnish the Department with written permission from the actual owner of the land on which the transferred outdoor dining is to be placed. If that land is privately owned, the Department shall consult with the Town Fire Marshal and must find and determine that use of adjoining private property for the proposed outdoor dining will not unreasonably restrict vehicular or pedestrian traffic or unduly jeopardize the safety and well-being of the proposed occupants of the space. If the land proposed for outdoor dining is owned by the Town or State the Planning Department does not have to make any additional findings. The use of private property or government property for transferred outdoor dining shall not obviate any limitations or requirements imposed hereby. 
[b] Such space must be configured such that the noise, light, and other effects generated by the outdoor dining use will be reasonably screened from adjacent properties. To this end, the Department may require fencing, landscape screening, and other noise attenuation measures as a condition of any permit. 
[c] Each and every outdoor dining area allowed under this Subdivision (3) must be compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and shall meet ADA requirements for accessibility. The Department may refer an application hereunder to the Fire Marshal or Building Inspector in order to ensure it meets ADA standards. 
Hours of outdoor use. 
[a] Utilization of any outdoor dining space approved under this Subdivision 
(3) shall be limited to the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. daily.

[d] All music and noise levels must comply with Chapter 185 of the Town Code, which lowers allowable decibel levels between the hours of 7:00 
p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
Lighting. Applicants that want or need outdoor lighting in connection with a transfer of outdoor dining area permit shall apply for an administrative 5 lighting permit pursuant to § 255-1-84 hereof. See Subparagraph (3)(b)[4] above. Any lighting granted by way of an administrative permit shall be turned off no later than 12:00 midnight each night. 
§ 255-11-88 EAST HAMPTON CODE § 255-11-88 
[9] Heating. The use of outdoor heating devices must be fully compliant with the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code as defined by New York State Codes, Rules and Regulations Title 19, Section 1219.1, or any successor regulation. The use of such devices must be approved by the Fire Marshal, and the placement thereof must be included on all submitted seating plans that may include heating device use. 
[10] Umbrellas. Umbrellas may be placed over tables in the outdoor dining area. Any such umbrellas must be shown on the submitted seating plans for an outdoor dining area. 
[11] Tents. Areas approved for outdoor dining under this permit may utilize one or more temporary tents, erected for a period of two weeks or less, provided that a permit for any such tents is first obtained from the Fire Marshal in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 141 of the Town Code. Tents to be erected for more than a two-week period require a building permit issued by the Building Inspector and Site Plan approval.

(a) 
A qualifying take-out food store as defined in § 255-1-20 of this Code shall be permitted seating of up to 16 seats on premises, which may be located inside or outside the premises, or a combination thereof, for their patrons to consume take-out food at their establishment. Such seating shall be located subject to all provisions of the New York State Building and Fire Code and in a manner which does not block pedestrian or vehicular traffic or parking.

(a) 
During the course of its review as a part of site plan review, the Architectural Review Board shall review the design, scale and appearance not only of particular units or structures, but also of the entire facility, especially with regard to its overall compatibility with present and potential uses of adjacent properties and structures, and with the character of the neighborhood generally. The Review Board shall approve only facilities whose design and scale are found to be so compatible. 

(b) 
The Planning Board shall review the site plan to ensure the installation of adequate sanitary waste disposal and water supply facilities and the maintenance of same. Such facilities must be designed so as to protect the groundwater reservoir from pollution, avoid saltwater intrusion into the aquifer on or off the site and not result in excessive water demand detrimental to neighboring properties or the environment. Approval of proposed sewage disposal and water supply facilities by any other governmental agency shall not in itself be deemed to compel the Planning Board to find that the requirements of this subsection have been met, unless the Board shall find that the environmental and community water supply protection goals of this section and this chapter have actually been achieved by such approval. Also, the Board may condition site plan approval on additional reasonable requirements beyond those which may have been called for by other governmental agencies having jurisdiction.

AMAGANSETT HISTORIC DISTRICT GUIDELINES 
[HISTORY: Added by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 6-2-2000 by L.L. No. 8-2000] § A-1. Location and composition of district. 
A. The Amagansett Historic District contains a mix of historic houses, barns, community buildings and commercial buildings in a rural setting. 
B. The essential character of the Historic District is established by the 30 farmhouses dating from the 18th Century through the 19th Century when Amagansett matured as a thriving agrarian community. The continuum of these farmhouses on either side of Main Street gives the Historic District much of its cohesive character. 
C. The remaining barns and agricultural land greatly enhance the rural setting of the farmhouses and maintain the connection with Amagansett's agrarian past. 
D. The community buildings and the historic commercial buildings occur at intervals up and down Main Street. These buildings are largely compatible with the neighboring farmhouses and contribute to the overall harmonious character of the Historic District. 
§ A-2. Preservation goals. 
Preservation goals for the Amagansett Historic District: 
A. Promote a harmonious and cohesive character for all of Main Street. 
B. Maintain and enhance the elements that contribute to the overall setting of the historic houses: open front yards and traditional fences along the street. 
C. Maintain the architectural integrity of the historic houses, especially of the front facades and other components visible from the street. 
D. Allow additions and other changes to rear walls and in appropriate ways to side walls to allow the historic houses to be adapted to changing needs and lifestyles. 
E. Maintain the architectural integrity of the barns and the integrity of their setting. 
F. Maintain the architectural integrity of the historic commercial buildings. 
G. Retain the rural and informal character of the Central Business District characterized by a mix of building types, by a significant amount of open space and by spaces between buildings. 
H. Guide redevelopment of nonhistoric buildings in the Central Business District to increase compatibility with neighboring historic commercial and residential buildings and with the character of the Historic District in general. 
§ A-3. Residence District Guidelines. 
These guidelines apply to all properties within the Residence District of the Amagansett Historic

§ A-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A-3 
D. Buildings. 
(1) 
Applicability and intent. 

(a) 
These guidelines refer primarily to the 27 historic residences which establish the essential character of this area of the Amagansett Historic District. 

(b) 
These guidelines also generally apply to other buildings in this district which include churches and commercial buildings. Additional guidelines that address the special character of some of these properties are found in supplemental guidelines for specific Residence District properties (§ A-4). 

(c) 
The intent of these guidelines is to maintain the architectural integrity of the historic buildings, especially of the front facades and of other components visible from the street. The guidelines allow changes that are compatible with the character of a historic property. 



(2) 
Work to the rear wall of a single-family residence that does not require a building permit is exempt from review. Any work to the rear wall of a single-family residence that does not require a building permit is exempt from review. 

(3) 
Wall material. The intent is to retain appropriate exterior materials, especially wood shingles. Wood-shingled exteriors predominate on Main Street and make a major contribution to the cohesive character of the Historic District. Two historic residences retain their original clapboard siding. 

(a) 
Historic buildings with wood shingle walls or clapboard walls should retain this treatment. 

(b) 
Replacing wood shingles with new wood shingles is exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church.

Any other proposal to renew the siding on a building requires review. 



(4) 
Roof material.

(b) 
Roof material is exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 



(5) 
Gutters and leaders.

(6) 
Doorways. The intent is to retain original front doorways that contribute to the historic character of a building. On many of the historic residences, the primary decorative emphasis is found at the front doorway. The elaborate doorways of the Greek Revival and Italianate-period houses make an especially strong contribution to the character of the Historic District. 


(a) Review is required for any proposal to replace a door or components of a door enframement. 
§ A-3 EAST HAMPTON CODE § A-3 
(b)

(7) 
Windows. The intent is to retain original windows that contribute to the historic character of a building, especially on the front facade. A large number of the historic residences retain the original windows and window sash. These are primarily the six-light sash of the Greek Revival and Italianate-period houses and the two-light sash of the Victorian era houses. These intact windows make a significant contribution to the architectural character and to the sense of authenticity of the Historic District. 

(a) 
Windows and their trim that contribute to the historic character of a building should be retained where reasonably feasible, as set forth below. 

(b) 
For any request to replace window components the Architectural Review Board will consider the contribution the existing windows make to the historic character of the building. Replacement components for important windows, especially those on the front facade, should match the material, configuration and dimensions of the original. 

(c) 
When a window is deteriorated and needs to be replaced, the Board will work with the home owner to find the best replacement at a reasonable cost. 

(d) 
Storm windows, window screens and window shutters are exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 

(e) 
Installing a skylight requires review. No skylight should be installed on the front roof slope of a building. 



(8) 
Front porches. The intent is to retain original porches that contribute to the historic character of a building. Thirteen historic residences on Main Street which date from 1870 to 1913 retain their original front porches. These porches are important aspects of the historic and architectural character of these houses. 

(a) 
Removing, replacing or installing a porch or porch posts, columns, balustrades, brackets and other important components requires review. Deteriorated components should be replaced in kind. 

(b) 
Repair or replacement of porch steps, porch flooring and railings to porch steps are exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 



(9) 
Paint. The historic residences on Main Street are about evenly divided between unpainted wood-shingle siding and painted-shingle or clapboard siding. White is the most common siding and trim color. These two simple color schemes (natural shingles with white trim and white siding with white trim) contribute to the traditional and rural character of Main Street. 


(a) 
Painting or staining is exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 

(b) 
Commercial properties are subject to the guidelines for paint found in the Central Business District guidelines (§ A-5). 


(10) 
Additions and alterations. 

(a) 
Additions and alterations are appropriate when they do not diminish the architectural integrity or the setting of a building. 

(b) 
Additions and alterations should not alter an important historic feature of a building and should be compatible with the historic character of the building and the district. 

(c) 
The addition or alteration should be compatible with the historic building and with the character of the district in scale, height, massing, proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings, roof form, texture, materials and architectural details. 

(d) 
Flexibility is required in reviewing additions and alterations to rear walls and to secondary side walls of houses where installation of doors, windows and additions with more glazing than found in the historic house can be expected. 

(e) 
Additions should be subordinate in scale to the historic building. 

(f) 
Existing additions in the Historic District may serve as precedents for proposed new additions. Many of the historic residences have rear additions which are stepped back from the side walls and smaller in scale than the original house. Some houses have small-scale additions set back on a side wall. 



(11) 
Nonhistoric residences. 

(a) 
Buildings constructed after 1950 are classified as nonhistoric buildings. In the Residence District there are three nonhistoric residences: 

311 Main Street 441 Montauk Highway 462 Montauk Highway 

(b) 
The intent of review of these nonhistoric residences is to see that any changes do not detract from the setting of a historic building and do not diminish the character of the Historic District. Therefore, any proposed changes to a nonhistoric building should be judged for their compatibility with neighboring historic buildings and with the character of the street and district in general. 

(c) 
Because most work on a nonhistoric residence would have little or no effect on the Historic District, these guidelines attempt to make the process as streamlined as possible. 




[1] Any work to a nonhistoric residence which does not require a building permit is exempt from review. 
Town of East Hampton, NY  
§ A-3  EAST HAMPTON CODE  § A-3  
[2]  Any work requiring a building permit is subject to review and shall be judged by the Architectural Review Board using the principles of compatibility in § 255-7-60 of the East Hampton Town Code.  
[3]  Any addition or alteration of a nonhistoric residence may be in the style of that residence. For example, an addition to the flat-roofed house at 441  

Montauk Highway may be in the same modern style. 
E. New construction. 
(1) 
Contemporary design. The Amagansett Historic District is a complex entity. It reflects a range of historical periods and contains many different building types. Contemporary designs should fit into the existing context while contributing to the sense of evolution and the complexity of the Historic District. 

(a) 
Contemporary designs that respond to the architectural traditions and character of the Historic District are encouraged. 

(b) 
Contemporary designs should relate to the forms, materials, details and other characteristics of the historic buildings, but are not required to imitate the historic styles of the existing buildings. 



(2) 
Accessory buildings. Any accessory building, such as a garage, shed and pool house, located in the back yard of a single-family residence is exempt from review. Placement and plans for accessory buildings at any other location will be reviewed. Generally these buildings should be compatible with the main building, its setting and with neighboring buildings. 

(3) 
Principal buildings. New buildings should be compatible with the historic buildings and with the character of the Historic District. Section 255-7-60B of the East Hampton Town Code provides criteria for judging the compatibility of new construction. These criteria, which are amplified below, define the basic design elements which establish the character of the Historic District. The design elements of a new building should be in harmony with the same elements of the surrounding historic buildings. 

(a) 
Setbacks and orientation. 

[1] New buildings should be sited on their lots corresponding to the setbacks of adjacent historic buildings. 
[2] The front facade of a new building should face the street. 

(b) 
Rhythm of spacing of buildings. The rhythm of buildings and the spaces between which characterize the district should be maintained by the siting of a new building on its lot. 

(c) 
Scale. The scale of a new building and its features should be in harmony with the scale of the historic residences in the district. 

(d) 
Height. The height of a new residence should be within the range of heights of the historic residences in the district. 

(e) 
Massing. New buildings should employ the traditional simple forms prevalent 




in the district. 
(f) 
Proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings. 

[1] The windows of a new building should generally be rectangular with a vertical proportion. 
[2] The arrangement of windows and doorways should produce a balanced facade. 
[3] The front facade and prominent side facades of new buildings should have a ratio of door and window area to wall area similar to that of the historic residences. 

(g) 
Roof form. New buildings should have a roof form typical of that of surrounding historic buildings. On Main Street gable roofs with unbroken slopes predominate. The roof slope should be within the range established by the historic roofs. 

(h) 
Materials. The materials of a new building should be in harmony with the materials of the historic residences. Wood shingles or clapboards are appropriate siding materials. 


F. Demolition. No building or structure or portion thereof that makes an important contribution to the district should be demolished. Exceptions to this rule may be granted by the Architectural Review Board only as follows. In considering a proposal to demolish a building or structure or portion of a building or structure the following guidelines apply: 
(1) 
The Architectural Review Board shall consider the historic and architectural significance of the building, the contribution the building makes to the Historic District and the impact of its removal on the character of the district. 

(2) 
If an application for demolition of an entire historic building is based on structural instability or deterioration, a technical report prepared by an architect or engineer is required. The report will detail the problems and provide cost estimates for their correction. 

(3) 
The Architectural Review Board may require adequate documentation of a historic building through photographs and measured drawings as a condition of approval when there is no alternative but demolition. 

(4) 
Before approval can be granted to demolish a building, the Architectural Review Board shall require plans for proposed new construction or other use of the site be submitted and approved. 


G. Relocation. The intent is to retain the historic buildings on their original sites. In the Amagansett Historic District each historic building contributes to the setting of the neighboring buildings and together they establish the larger setting of the Historic District. 
(1) The Architectural Review Board will consider the historic and architectural significance of the building, the contribution the building makes to the Historic District on its existing site and the impact of its relocation on the character of the district. 
§ A-3 EAST HAMPTON CODE § A-4 
(2) Before approval can be granted to relocate a building, the Architectural Review Board shall require plans for proposed new construction or other use of the site be submitted and approved. 
H. Flag lots. The Residence District of the Amagansett Historic District includes the access strips to seven flag lots. The main portion of these lots and the buildings on them are not in the district. The owners of these access strips are required to submit an application only for any fence, wall or gate proposed within the designated access strip. 
§ A-4. Supplemental guidelines for specific Residence District properties. 
The above Residence District guidelines apply to all properties in the residence zone. Since many of these guidelines apply most directly to houses, some additional guidelines are appropriate for the commercial and community buildings in the Residence District. 
A. 303 Main Street, Commercial Building. 
(1) 
A small-scale commercial building has been at this site since 1860. The existing building is compatible with the character of the district in scale, massing, materials and roof form. 

(2) 
Any alterations or redevelopment should increase compatibility with neighboring historic residences and should maintain their setting. 


B. 367 and 375 Main Street, Amagansett Farmer's Market. 
(1) 
The open space and agricultural land of these properties makes a very important contribution to the setting of historic residences in the area and of the Historic District as a whole. The small-scale commercial building has a minimal impact on the rural and agricultural setting of these two properties. 

(2) 
Any alterations, redevelopment or new construction should be compatible with the character of neighboring historic residences and should, as far as possible, maintain the contribution these properties make to the setting of the historic residences and of the Historic District in general. 


C. 415 Main Street, Restaurant. 
(1) 
The setback, massing, roof form and materials of this commercial building are in harmony with the character of the Historic District. The significant open space around the building helps to mitigate its large scale. 

(2) 
Any alterations or redevelopment should enhance compatibility with neighboring historic residences. 


D. Long Island Rail Road Freight Depot. 
(1) 
The 1895 Amagansett Freight Depot is a rare intact example of this building type. Distinguishing features include the brick walls; hip roof with wide, bracketed eaves; and the original arched door and window openings. 

(2) 
The architectural integrity of the 1895 Freight Depot should be maintained. 


E. St. Thomas' Chapel. 
§ A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A-5 
(1) 
This intact church makes an important contribution to the Historic District. 

(2) 
The architectural integrity of St. Thomas' Chapel and its open setting should be maintained. 

(3) 
Alterations, additions or redevelopment of the rectory should be compatible with the Chapel. 

(4) 
Modifications deemed liturgically necessary should be readily accommodated per the requirements of the Church. 


F. 286 Main Street, St. Peter the Apostle Roman Catholic Church. 
(1) 
This church with its small-scale, modest design, shingled exterior and open setting contributes to the rural character of the Historic District. It is understood that because of the small size of this church and a growing congregation, building a new church or an addition to the existing church may some day be necessary. 

(2) 
Modifications deemed liturgically necessary should be readily accommodated per the requirements of the parish. 

(3) 
Any alterations or additions should be compatible with the character of the church, neighboring residences and their setting. 


G. 350 Main Street, United Presbyterian Church. 
(1) 
This is one of the most significant buildings in the Historic District and it retains many original exterior features. 

(2) 
The architectural integrity of the church should be maintained. 

(3) 
Modifications deemed liturgically necessary should be readily accommodated per the requirements of the church. 


§ A-5. Central Business District guidelines. 
These guidelines apply to all properties within the Central Business District of the Amagansett Historic District. The Central Business District contains a mix of both historic and recent commercial buildings as well as some of the most important historic residential and agricultural properties in the Amagansett Historic District. Maintaining the architectural integrity of the historic houses and barns and the integrity of their setting is critical to maintaining the overall cohesive character of the Historic District. Commercial buildings began to be interspersed with the residences on Main Street toward the end of the 19th Century. This pattern remains part of the character of Main Street today. The historic commercial buildings represent a variety of types, materials and periods which, along with the mix of historic residences, contributes to the rural and informal character of the Central Business District. Maintaining the architectural integrity of the historic commercial buildings is essential to preserve this special character of the Amagansett business district. More recently commercial development has been concentrated on the north side of Main Street in the vicinity of the town parking lot; the compatibility of this row of commercial buildings with other areas of Main Street is a critical factor in maintaining the integrity of the Historic District. 
A. Preservation goals for the Central Business District: 
§ A-5 EAST HAMPTON CODE § A-5 
(1) 
Retain the architectural integrity and the setting of the historic houses and the historic barns. 

(2) 
Maintain the architectural integrity of the historic commercial buildings. 

(3) 
Retain the rural and informal character of the Central Business. District characterized by a mix of building types, by a significant amount of open space and by spaces between buildings. 

(4) 
Guide redevelopment of nonhistoric buildings to increase compatibility with neighboring historic commercial and residential buildings and with the character of the Historic District in general. 


B. All properties. 
(1) 
Exterior lighting. 

(a) 
Exterior lighting should be appropriate to the rural character of the Historic District and compatible with the residential areas of the district. Lighting of signs, entrances and of surrounding areas is subject to review. 

(b) 
Light directed on signs should spill beyond the borders of the sign as little as possible. 

(c) 
Incandescent lamps and full-spectrum fluorescent lamps are the most appropriate light sources. 

(d) 
Internally illuminated signs are not appropriate. 



(2) 
Awnings. 

(a) 
Awnings should be appropriate to the rural character of the Historic District. 

(b) 
Traditional fabric awnings with a straight front and a straight sloping canopy with or without a valence are appropriate. 



(3) 
Paint. Consistency in exterior finishes can enhance the compatibility between commercial and residential buildings and between recent commercial buildings and historic commercial buildings. Like the historic houses, either natural wood shingles or a white-painted exterior predominate among the historic commercial buildings. 

(a) 
Colors of historic buildings should be appropriate to their period and style, taking into account the significance of their evolution over time. 

(b) 
Historic buildings with either natural-shingle siding or with shingle or clapboard siding painted white should retain those treatments. 

(c) 
Natural-shingle siding or siding painted white along with white trim are appropriate finishes. 

(d) 
Other colors used should harmonize with the colors of the historic buildings and with the setting of the Historic District. 




C. Historic commercial buildings. 
(1) These guidelines apply to the nine historic commercial buildings in the Central Business District: 
137 Main Street, Black's Variety Store (The Tack Trunk) 171 Main Street, Bluff Road Life Saving Station (Outdoor) 203 Main Street, Second Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (Amagansett 
Wine and Spirits) 
207 Main Street, First Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (The Coach 
Factory Store) 
225 Main Street, Rackett & Company (Garnham and Han Real Estate) 
231 Main Street, Joe's Restaurant (Gordon's Restaurant) 
255 Main Street, Amagansett Food Market (Home Nature) 
11 Indian Wells Plain Highway, Nicholl's Livery Stable 
136 Main Street, Amagansett Garage 
(2) 
The historic commercial buildings on Main Street make a major contribution to the cohesive character of the Historic District. The general small scale of these buildings, the wood facades, the residential second-floor windows, and their siting as separate individual buildings all contribute to a rural and informal character that is compatible with the character of the residential area of Main Street. 

(3) 
Original features of the historic commercial buildings should be retained, including overall design; original materials of the front facade; original storefronts; parapets and cornices; original details; and original upper-floor residential windows. Open spaces that contribute to their setting should also be maintained. 

(4) 
Any alterations should not remove or obscure important original features and should be compatible with the historic character of the building. 

(5) 
Additional guidelines for some properties are found in the supplemental guidelines for specific Central Business District properties (§ A-6). 


D. Nonhistoric buildings and new construction. These guidelines apply to alteration or redevelopment of nonhistoric buildings and to new construction. Buildings constructed after 1950 are classified as nonhistoric buildings. The alteration or redevelopment of nonhistoric buildings could have a significant impact on the character of the Historic District. New commercial buildings may also be constructed. Existing features of nonhistoric buildings that are compatible with the Historic District should be maintained. Alterations, redevelopment and new construction should be compatible with the historic commercial buildings and with the character of the Historic District in general. Additional guidelines for some properties are found in the supplemental guidelines for specific Central Business District properties (§ A-6). 
(1) Contemporary design. The Amagansett Historic District is a complex entity. It reflects a range of historical periods and contains many different building types. Contemporary designs should fit into the existing context while contributing to the sense of evolution and the complexity of the Historic District. 
§ A-5  EAST HAMPTON CODE  § A-5  
(a)  Contemporary designs that respond to the architectural traditions and character  
of the Historic District are encouraged.  
(b)  Contemporary designs should relate to the forms, materials, details and other  
characteristics of the historic buildings but are not required to imitate the historic  

styles of the existing buildings. 
(2) 
Rhythm of spacing of buildings. Historic commercial development is characterized by small-scale individual buildings, many of which are separated from others by significant open space. These characteristics contribute to the rural character of the Historic District. 

(a) 
Alteration, redevelopment or new construction should enhance this characteristic of separate individual buildings. 

(b) 
Alteration or redevelopment of buildings joined by a party wall should distinguish the building to avoid the appearance of a commercial block. 

(c) 
Open spaces between buildings should be retained. 



(3) 
Scale. Most of the historic commercial buildings, with the exception of the Nicholl's Livery Stable and the Amagansett Garage, have a scale similar to that of the historic houses. 

(a) The scale of any new or redeveloped commercial building should be in harmony with the average scale of the historic commercial buildings. 

(4) 
Second stories. The second stories of historic commercial buildings, with their residential windows, enhance their compatibility with the residential area of Main Street. 

(a) 
Second stories with windows having the scale, proportion and arrangement of the windows of the historic houses are appropriate. 

(b) 
Existing second stories and their residential windows should be retained with repairs and replacements in kind where necessary. 



(5) 
Display windows. Most of the historic commercial buildings have display windows of a vertical, square, or slightly horizontal proportion. 

(a) Display windows of the proportions of those in the historic commercial buildings are appropriate. 

(6) 
Materials. Most of the historic commercial buildings have wood facades and wood exteriors predominate throughout the Historic District. 

(a) 
Front facades of shingles or clapboards with wood trim and storefronts with wood display window frames and wood doors are appropriate. 

(b) 
Existing wood facades and storefronts should be retained with repairs and replacements in kind where necessary. 



(7) 
Building details. The historic commercial buildings, like the historic residences, have relatively plain exteriors. 

(a) The restrained use of ornament is appropriate. 

E. 
Historic houses and barns. 

(1) 
These guidelines apply to the seven historic residences and two historic barns within the Central Business District. These properties are: 

129 Main Street, Miss Amelia's Cottage 137 Main Street, Jonathan Schellinger Barn 145 Main Street, Jonathan Schellinger House and Shed 161 Main Street, Erastus Barnes House (Steven Talkhouse) 215 Main Street, Amagansett Free Library 249 Main Street, J. Mason Schellinger House (WEHM/WBEA) 261 Main Street, George L. Baker House 154 Main Street, C.W. Rackett House (Amagansett Square) 

(2) 
The goal is to maintain the architectural integrity of these buildings and the integrity of their residential or agricultural setting. The guidelines found in the Residence District guidelines (§ A-3) also apply to these properties, unless superseded by guidelines in this section. Additional guidelines for these properties are found in the supplemental guidelines for specific Central Business District properties (§ A-6). 



F. 
Demolition. No building or structure or portion thereof that makes an important contribution to the district should be demolished. Exceptions to this rule may be granted by the Architectural Review Board only as follows. In considering a proposal to demolish a building or structure or portion of a building or structure the following guidelines apply: 

(1) 
The Architectural Review Board shall consider the historic and architectural significance of the building, the contribution the building makes to the Historic District, and the impact of its removal on the character of the district. 

(2) 
If an application for demolition of an entire historic building is based on structural instability or deterioration, a technical report prepared by an architect or engineer is required. The report will detail the problems and provide cost estimates for their correction. 

(3) 
The Architectural Review Board may require adequate documentation of a historic building through photographs and measured drawings as a condition of approval when there is no alternative but demolition. 

(4) 
Before approval can be granted to demolish a building, the Architectural Review Board shall require plans for proposed new construction or other use of the site be submitted and approved. 



G. 
Relocation. The intent is to retain the historic buildings on their original sites. In the Amagansett Historic District each historic building contributes to the setting of the neighboring buildings and together they establish the larger setting of the Historic District. 


(1) The Architectural Review Board will consider the historic and architectural 
§ A-5 EAST HAMPTON CODE § A-6 
significance of the building, the contribution the building makes to the Historic District on its existing site, and the impact of its relocation on the character of the district. 
(2) Before approval can be granted to relocate a building, the Architectural Review Board shall require plans for proposed new construction or other use of the site be submitted and approved. 
§ A-6. Supplemental guidelines for specific Central Business District properties. 
A. 129 Main Street, Miss Amelia's Cottage. 
(1) 
This property is important both for the Cottage and for the large open space. This property and the Jonathan Schellinger Farm Complex to the east have the potential to greatly enhance the setting of one another. 

(2) 
Maintain the architectural integrity of the Cottage and the Roy K. Lester Barn. 

(3) 
Retain the open land between the Cottage and the Jonathan Schellinger Farm Complex properties. 


B. Jonathan Schellinger Farm Complex 137 Main Street, Jonathan Schellinger Barn and Black's Variety Store (The Tack Trunk) 145 Main Street, Jonathan Schellinger House and Shed. 
(1) 
The two properties which contain the Jonathan Schellinger House and Barn comprise one of the most important components of the Amagansett Historic District. No other property represents Amagansett's agrarian past as does the Jonathan Schellinger Farm Complex. 

(2) 
Maintain the architectural integrity of the house and barn. Maintain all original fabric of the shed, which may have been Samuel Schellinger's woodworking shop. 

(3) 
Maintain the historic relationships between the buildings and between the buildings and their setting. 

(4) 
Black's Variety Store, originally a rear addition to the Jonathan Schellinger House, was moved and converted into a store about 1922. This building represents the historic development of commercial properties on Main Street where small-scale buildings were located close to the street between residences. 


C. 161 Main Street, Erastus Barnes House (Steven Talkhouse). 
(1) 
Although this early 19th Century dwelling has been altered it continues to make a contribution to the Historic District. 

(2) 
Maintain the frame and exterior form of the original dwelling. 

(3) 
Maintain the three original window openings at the second floor of the front wall. 

(4) 
Maintain the features of the front addition that contribute to its appearance as an enclosed porch. Any alterations should enhance its character as an enclosed porch. 

(5) 
Alterations to other additions should be compatible with the original dwelling. 


§ A-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § A-6 
D. 171 Main Street, Bluff Road Life Saving Station (Outdoor). 
(1) 
The 1880 station was moved to Main Street in 1902 and converted into a store. Although altered by the modern storefront addition, this building is significant as a life saving station and for its contribution to the rural and informal character of the business district. 

(2) 
Maintain the frame and exterior form of the original life saving station. 

(3) 
Maintain original exterior features including the wide eaves, bargeboards with scroll ends and brackets under the eaves. 


E. 215 Main Street, Amagansett Free Library. 
(1) 
This 1790 house in a residential setting at the center of the most built-up section of the business district is a critical component of the Historic District. 

(2) 
Maintain the architectural integrity of the house. 

(3) 
Maintain the open setting between the house and the street and to either side of the original house. 


F. 249 Main Street, J. Mason Schellinger House (WEHM/WBEA). 
(1) 
The roofline of this one-story cape was altered in the 1880s and the house was moved back from the street and turned 90° in the 1970s. It retains little integrity and makes a minor contribution compared to the other historic houses in the Central Business District. 

(2) 
Maintain the frame of the original dwelling. Maintain residential features including the windows and front doorway of the 1880s renovation. 

(3) 
Any alterations should enhance the residential character. 


G. 261 Main Street, George L. Baker House. 
(1) 
This 1853 house retains a high level of integrity and is one of the important group of five intact Greek Revival and Italianate dwellings in the district which, along with the 1860 Presbyterian Church, represent Amagansett's maturity as a prosperous independent community. 

(2) 
During this period houses were sited farther from the street allowing front yards, but the setback of this house is unusually great. A commercial use of this house could lead to a proposal to move the house toward the street in order to provide parking to the rear. This is one of the few houses in the Historic District that could be relocated on its lot without seriously diminishing its integrity of setting. 

(3) 
Maintain the architectural integrity of the main house and of the west wing. 

(4) 
Maintain the open setting between the house and the street. 

(5) 
Locate any parking area behind the house. 

(6) 
If the house were moved toward the street to meet parking requirements, the setback should be appropriate for its period and be in the range of setbacks of other houses of 


§ A-6 EAST HAMPTON CODE § A-6 
the 1850 - 1875 period on Main Street. 
(7) As long as this property remains a single-family residence, all work that is exempt from review for a single-family residence [§ A-3B(1)] is exempt for this property. 
H. 11 Indian Wells Plain Highway Nicholl's Livery Stable. 
(1) 
The Nicholl's Livery Stable is a rare surviving building type associated with the early Amagansett summer colony and has an outstanding level of architectural integrity. It is anticipated that adapting this building to a new use will require additional windows at the first floor and possibly new windows for the second floor. The west and south walls are the most significant character-defining facades of the livery stable; the ARB realizes flexibility is required in reviewing changes to the secondary north and east walls. 

(2) 
Maintain the architectural integrity by retaining important features, including barn doors; hay loft doors; vertical-board siding; roof eaves; original windows, especially on the west and south walls; and the barn red exterior with white trim. 

(3) 
Nonhistoric additions and altered windows may be removed from the building. 

(4) 
Any site plan review should have the goal of opening up a view from Main Street. 


I. 130 Main Street, Mobil Station. 
(1) 
The most significant feature of this property is the open space at the west end which provides the potential for Nicholl's Livery Stable to make a greater visual contribution to Main Street. 

(2) 
Any changes should be reviewed to enhance compatibility with the Historic District. 

(3) 
Any site plan review should have the goals of maintaining the open space west of the building, removing intrusions from that space and enhancing the visibility of Nicholl's Livery Stable from Main Street. 


J. 136 Main Street, Amagansett Garage. 
(1) 
This circa 1920 automobile dealership and repair shop introduced a new building type to Main Street. 

(2) 
Maintain the architectural integrity of the two-story main building. 


K. 154 Main Street, C.W. Rackett House and Amagansett Square. 
(1) 
The front of the original 18th Century house faced west and the gable end faced the street. During the last quarter of the 19th Century, a new front doorway in the gable end and additions with porches gave the house a new "front" facing the street. The house represents the evolution of Main Street during the 19th Century and is particularly important for the intact porch on the west addition. 

(2) 
Maintain the architectural integrity of the house by retaining historic features, including early shingle siding; early windows and sash; front doorway; porch; and white painted exterior. 

(3) 
Maintain the open setting between the house and the street and the open space 


surrounding the house. 
(4) Review any proposed changes to the more recent buildings at Amagansett Square to enhance compatibility with the setting of the historic house. The individual buildings should remain smaller in scale and secondary in all characteristics to the historic house.

BLUFF ROAD HISTORIC DISTRICT GUIDELINES 
[HISTORY: Added by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 9-19-2002 by L.L. No. 29-2002] § B-1. Location and composition of district. 
A. The fourteen summer cottages constructed between 1892 and 1915 strung out along the top of the bluff overlooking the dunes and the Atlantic Ocean establish the essential character of the Bluff Road Historic District. 
B. These fourteen historic houses of Amagansetts summer colony share a similar modest size and an informal and unpretentious design. They share many features of the Shingle style including an overall picturesque composition, irregular roof lines, verandas and upper-story porches often incorporated into the volume of the house and wood shingle siding. These similarities gave the historic district a consistent architectural character. 
C. The relationship of these summer cottages to each other and to the Atlantic Ocean is a defining feature of the historic district. All the summer cottages face south with windows and porches opening to the ocean view and breezes. Houses at the east end of the district are on a flat plateau on top of the bluff overlooking the ocean. These houses share the same setbacks on lots of similar width, establishing a regular rhythm and a village scale. The houses at the west end of the district are set on the dune crest, evoking their direct relationship to the Atlantic Ocean. 
D. The 100 acre double dune area south of Bluff Road retains the open, natural appearance it had when the cottages were built. Bluff Road retains its rural character with informal edges and natural vegetation. This intact setting preserves the relationship between the cottages and the ocean and is one of the strongest unifying features of the Bluff Road Historic District. 
E. Within the historic district are four public buildings which are associated with the Naval Direction-Finding Station which operated here from 1921 until 1946. Because of the attempt to camouflage these buildings by giving them a residential appearance they are compatible with the character of the historic district. 
F. The Bluff Road Historic District Designation Proposal further describes the individual properties and the character of the historic district. 
§ B-2. Preservation goals for the Bluff Road Historic District. 
A. Maintain the architectural integrity of the historic houses, especially of the front facades and other components visible from the road. 
§ B-2 EAST HAMPTON CODE § B-3 
B. Allow additions and other changes to rear facades and in appropriate ways to side facades to allow the historic houses to be adapted to changing needs and lifestyles. 
C. Maintain the features of each property that contribute to the setting; the siting of the houses; open front yards; and low fences. 
D. Retain other features of the setting that maintain the relationship of the houses to the Atlantic Ocean including the rural character of Bluff Road and the open dune area. 
E. Enhance the setting by encouraging restoration of views from Bluff Road across the dunes to the ocean. 
F. Protect the character of Bluff Road by requiring that new construction or redevelopment of "non-historic" properties be compatible with the character of the district established by the historic houses. 
G. Maintain the architectural integrity of public buildings of historic significance, maintain the features of public property that contribute to the setting of the historic district, and require that any changes to public property be compatible with the character of the historic district. 
§ B-3. Summary of work that is exempt from review. 
A. Work that is exempt from review for a property with a historic house: 
(1) 
Installing a new roof coverning of wood shingles, asphalt shingles or fiber cement shingles that accurately replicate the appearance wood shingles. 

(2) 
Any resurfacing of a flat roof (slope of less than 3 in 12). 

(3) 
Replacing wood shingles on side walls with new shingles of the same material, texture and coursing. 

(4) 
Painting an existing painted surface. 

(5) 
Application of a clear wood preservative on wood shingle siding. 

(6) 
Storm/screen windows and storm/screen doors. 

(7) 
Window shutters. 

(8) 
Gutters and leaders. 

(9) 
Repair or replacement-in-kind of porch steps, porch flooring and railings to porch steps. 

(10) 
Any work to the rear wall that does not require a building permit. 

(11) 
Any work in the backyard except an addition to the residence. 

(12) 
Installing a post-and-rail fence with two rails. 

(13) 
Resurfacing existing driveways. 

(14) 
Walkways. 

(15) 
Doorway and porch lanterns and landscape lighting with 100 watt or less 


incandescent bulbs located and shielded so that no glare and no direct light extends beyond the property line. 
(16) Any minor repair where the purpose of the repair is to correct deterioration of a feature and to restore that feature to its original condition. 
B. Work that is exempt from review for a property with a non-historic house: 
(1) 
All work listed above that is exempt for an historic house. 

(2) 
Any work to the house itself which does not require a building permit. 


A. Work in the back yard of a residence is exempt from review. All work in the back yard of a residence is exempt from review except for an addition to the residence. 

B. Fences and walls. 
(1) 
The intent is to retain the rural character of Bluff Road and the relationship between the houses and the road by approving appropriate low fences along the road boundary. 

(2) 
Four properties have post-and-rail fences with two rails. This type of fence contributes to an open and rural setting and is appropriate for this district. 

(3) 
The Board recognizes that fencing for deer is a concern on Bluff Road. The wire fence on the inside of the privet hedge and the simple picket driveway gate at 298 Bluff Road is an example of appropriate deer fencing for this district. 

(a) 
Any fence along the front property line should contribute to an open and rural setting. 

(b) 
Installing a post-and-rail fence with two rails is exempt from review. 

(c) 
The following fences and walls would detract from the setting of the historic 




§ B-4 EAST HAMPTON CODE § B-4 
district and would be inappropriate along the front property line: 
[1] A solid board fence; 
[2] A chain link fence; and 
[3] A masonry wall. 
C. Grade changes, berms and retaining walls. 
(1) 
The natural topography of the bluff and dunes enhances the setting of the summer cottages and is an important feature of the Bluff Road Historic District. The houses at the east end of the district are on a flat plateau on top of the bluff and those at the west end are often sited at the crest of the dune. Each house is sited to have a direct and open relationship to Bluff Road and to the Atlantic Ocean. 

(2) 
Changing the grade and installing berms or retaining walls can affect the setting of the houses, their relationship with Bluff Road, their relationship to the ocean vista and the sense of the natural topography. 

(a) 
Changing the grade so as to alter the natural topography or to alter the dune or bluff setting of a property is not appropriate in the historic district. 

(b) 
Berms and retaining walls along the front property line or in the front yard are not appropriate in the historic district. 




D. Driveways. 
(1) 
The intent is to encourage driveways which contribute to the rural character of Bluff Road. 

(2) 
Driveways on Bluff Road are sited to have a minimal impact on the setting of the historic houses. Most are narrow driveways along the side property line with parking areas to the rear of the house. Only one property has a small parking area in the front yard. 

(a) 
A plan to install a new driveway or alter the width or location of an existing driveway will be reviewed for its impact on the setting of the historic district. 

(b) 
Semi-circular driveways or parking areas that would encroach on the front lawn are not appropriate in the historic district. 

(c) 
Any resurfacing of an existing driveway is exempt from review. 




E. Tennis courts, swimming pools, decks and terraces. A new tennis court, swimming pool, deck or terrace should not detract from the setting of the historic buildings. 
(1) 
A tennis court, swimming pool, deck or terrace and associated fencing located in the back yard is exempt from review. The most appropriate fencing would not extend forward of the rear wall of the house. To the extent that fencing extends forward of the back yard, it is not exempt from review. 

(2) 
Swimming pools and tennis courts should be located to the rear of the residence. If the configuration of a lot does not allow a swimming pool in the back yard, the Board will consider the impact of the pool or tennis court at the proposed location on the 


setting of the properties in the district. A pool or tennis court should not be located in the front yard of any property in the district. 
(3) Decks and terraces will be reviewed for their location and impact on the setting and architectural integrity of an historic house and the setting of other properties in the district. 
F. Exterior lighting. 
(1) 
Lighting should be consistent with the residential character of Bluff Road. Lighting of one property should not impact an adjacent property. 

(2) 
Exterior lighting can affect the setting of an historic building, neighboring buildings, and the district in general. Existing lighting is primarily confined to incandescent fixtures at entrances and porches. 

(a) 
Light fixtures should be appropriate to the residential character of the district. Light fixtures should be located and shielded so that no glare and no direct light extends beyond the property line. Fixtures should use incandescent bulbs (100 watts maximum). 

(b) 
Doorway and porch lanterns and landscape lighting, which meet the above guideline, are exempt from review. 




§ B-5. Guidelines for historic houses. 
A. Work to the rear wall that does not require a building permit is exempt from review. Any work to the rear wall of a house that does not require a building permit is exempt from review. 
B. Wall material. All fourteen historic houses in the district have natural (not painted or stained) wood shingle siding. This consistent wall material makes a major contribution to the cohesive character of the Bluff Road Historic District. 
(1) 
Historic houses with wood shingle walls should retain this treatment. 

(2) 
Replacing wood shingles with new shingles of the same material, texture and coursing is exempt from review. 

(3) 
Any other proposal to replace the siding on a building requires review. 


C. Roof material. Roof material is about evenly divided between wood shingles and asphalt shingles. 
(1) 
Installing a new roof using any of the following materials is exempt from review: 

(a) 
Wood shingles; 

(b) 
Asphalt shingles; or 

(c) 
Fiber cement shingles that accurately replicate the appearance of wood shingles. 



(2) 
Installing a roof of any other material requires review. 

(3) 
Any resurfacing of a flat roof (slope of less than 3 in 12) is exempt from review. 


§ B-5 EAST HAMPTON CODE § B-5 
(4) Gutters and leaders are exempt from review. 
D. Doorways. 
(1) 
The intent is to retain original doorways that contribute to the historic character of a building. 

(2) 
Many of the front entrances have special treatment with sidelights, transoms or pediments and many retain the original front door. 

(a) 
Review is required for any proposal to replace a door or components of a door enframement. 

(b) 
All significant elements of an original front doorway, including the door, should be retained and repaired instead of replaced. If replacement of any component is necessary, the new material should match that being replaced. 

(c) 
When a door is deteriorated and needs to be replaced, the Board will work with the home owner to find the best replacement at a reasonable cost. 

(d) 
Installing a storm/screen door at any doorway is exempt from review. 

(e) 
For any residence, installing an access to a door for the physically handicapped is exempt from review. 




E. Windows. 
(1) 
The intent is to retain original windows that contribute to the historic character of a house, especially on the front facade. 

(2) 
Many of the historic houses retain the original window sash which include the multi-pane and diamond-pane sash typical of the Shingle style. While most houses have plain window trim, special treatments such as pedimented windows, Palladian windows, large stair hall windows and eyebrow dormers give modest decorative emphasis to some houses. The original windows make a significant contribution to the architectural character and to the sense of authenticity of the historic district. 

(a) 
Windows and their trim that contribute to the historic character of a house should be retained where reasonably feasible, as set forth below. 

(b) 
For any request to replace window components the Architectural Review Board will consider the contribution the existing windows make to the historic character of the house. Replacement components for important windows, especially those on the front facade, should match the material, configuration and dimensions of the original. 

(c) 
When a window is deteriorated and needs to be replaced, the Board will work with the home owner to find the best replacement at a reasonable cost. 

(d) 
Storm windows, window screens and window shutters are exempt from review. 

(e) 
Installing a skylight requires review. 




F. Porches. 
(1) 
The intent is to retain original porches that contribute to the historic character of a house. 

(2) 
Thirteen of the fourteen historic cottages retain wide porches and many also have upper-story porches. Many of the porches have shingled posts and shingled balustrades or white classical columns, both typical of the Shingle style. These porches are another common element which gives the district such a cohesive quality. The porches also convey the relationship of the houses to their setting on the bluff overlooking the Atlantic. 

(3) 
Retaining these porches is one of the most important factors in maintaining the character of the Bluff Road Historic District. 

(a) 
Removing, replacing or installing a porch or porch posts, columns, balustrades, brackets, and other important components requires review. Deteriorated components should be replaced in kind. 

(b) 
Enclosing part of a porch with traditional divided-light storm panels can be an appropriate alteration. 

(c) 
Repair or replacement-in-kind of porch steps, porch flooring and railings to porch steps are exempt from review. 




G. Paint and stain. 
(1) 
The natural shingle siding of the fourteen historic houses is an important unifying feature of the historic district. 

(2) 
All fourteen historic houses have white trim. Historically a greater variety of trim colors were found on these houses. Trim color is not as important as the natural shingle siding in establishing the character of the district. 

(3) 
Because the most important historic "finish" to maintain is the unpainted shingle siding, only proposals to paint or stain natural wood shingle siding will be subject to review. 

(a) 
Any painting of an existing painted surface is exempt from review. 

(b) 
Application of a clear wood preservative on wood shingle siding is exempt from review. 

(c) 
Any proposal to paint or stain natural wood shingle siding requires review. 




H. Additions and alterations. 
(1) 
Over the past century the cottages on Bluff Road have been enlarged with additions to rear or side walls that were designed to have a minimal effect on the form and integrity of the main house. The goal of the historic district is to continue this tradition of building additions that respect the character of the historic house. 

(2) 
Additions and alterations are appropriate when they do not diminish the architectural integrity or the setting of a house in the district. 

(3) 
It is not the intent of these guidelines to lessen the floor area that could be built under 


§ B-5 EAST HAMPTON CODE § B-6 
the zoning code, but to accommodate all reasonable plans to enlarge houses as allowed by zoning. Proposals to substantially enlarge some houses in the district are anticipated. Some proposals may include plans to relocate the house on the lot. The Architectural Review Board will work with the home owner to find the most reasonable balance between additions and relocation in order to achieve the expansion in a way that alters the architectural integrity of the house or the setting of the historic district as little as possible. 
(a) 
Additions should not detract from the form and integrity of the historic house, especially as viewed from Bluff Road. 

(b) 
Additions and alterations should not alter an important historic feature of a house and should be compatible with the historic house and with the character of the district in scale, massing, proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings, roof form, texture, materials and architectural details. 

(c) 
No additions should be placed on the facade facing Bluff Road. 

(d) 
Additions set back on the rear wall are encouraged. For some properties the configuration of the lot and the location of the historic house make a sizeable rear addition impractical. For these properties, flexibility is required in considering a side addition that is reasonably larger than would be the case where a rear addition is possible. 

(e) 
Additions to a side wall are appropriate when they are secondary to the historic house. A side addition should be set back from the front wall of the historic house and be subordinate in size and scale to the historic house. Open and enclosed porches are traditional and appropriate additions to side walls. 

(f) 
Flexibility is required in reviewing additions and alterations to rear walls and to secondary side walls of houses where installation of doors, windows, and additions with larger areas of glass than found in the historic house can be expected. 

(g) 
The maximum width in feet times the maximum height in feet of the front elevation of a proposed side addition should be less than half the maximum width in feet times the maximum height in feet of the front elevation of the historic house. This guideline does not apply to properties, such as 266 Bluff Road, where the configuration of the lot and the location of the historic house make a sizeable rear addition impractical. [Added 3-17-2006 by L.L. No. 5-2006] 


§ B-6. Guidelines for non-historic houses. 
A. In the Bluff Road Historic District there are six non-historic houses. This classification is made on the individual property sheets in the historic district designation report. These six properties are: 
294 Bluff Road 326 Bluff Road 346 Bluff Road 
123 Hedges Lane 325 Bluff Road 375 Bluff Road 
B. The intent of review of these non-historic houses is to see that any changes do not detract from the setting of an historic house and do not diminish the character of the historic district. Therefore any proposed changes to a nonhistoric-house should be judged for their compatibility with neighboring historic houses and with the character of the Bluff Road Historic District. 
C. Because most work on a non-historic house would have little or no effect on the historic district, these guidelines attempt to make the process as streamlined as possible. 
(1) 
Any work to a non-historic house which does not require a building permit is exempt from review. 

(2) 
Any work requiring a building permit is subject to review and shall be judged by the Architectural Review Board using the principles of compatibility in § 255-7-60 of the East Hampton Town Code. 

(3) 
325 Bluff Road has a unique circumstance being set back approximately 900 south of Bluff Road. The Board will take into account the degree to which the proposed work will be visible from Bluff Road. Priority would be given to the compatibility of the most visible features of the proposed work. 

(4) 
Any addition or alteration of a non-historic house may be in the style of that house. 


§ B-7. Guidelines for new construction. 
A. Accessory buildings. 
(1) 
Existing garages and other outbuildings are in hack yards and most are set well back from the road and have very little impact on the setting of the Bluff Road Historic District. 

(2) 
Any accessory building, such as a garage, shed or pool house, located in the "back yard" of a residence is exempt from review. 

(3) 
Placement and plans for accessory buildings at any other location will be reviewed. 

(a) 
Accessory buildings should be sited to the rear of the main building. If the configuration of a lot does not allow the structure to be placed in the back yard, the Board will consider the impact of the structure at the proposed location on the setting of the properties in the district. An accessory building should not be located in the front yard of any property in the district. 

(b) 
Accessory buildings such as garages, sheds and pool houses should be compatible with the main building, its setting and with neighboring buildings. 




B. Residences. 
(1) There is one vacant parcel at the midpoint of the string of historic houses on Bluff 
§ B-7 EAST HAMPTON CODE § B-7 
Road. A new residence here will affect the setting of the historic district. The six non-historic houses have the potential to be redeveloped. 
(2) 
The design of new construction should respond to the architectural traditions and character of the Bluff Road Historic District as established by the historic houses. A new building should fit into the existing context while preserving the sense of evolution and the authenticity of the historic district. Particularly important is compatibility of siting, size, scale, height, massing and materials. 

(3) 
Section 255-7-60B of the East Hampton Town Code provides criteria for judging the compatibility of new construction. These criteria, which are amplified below, define the basic design elements which establish the character of the historic district. The design elements of a new building should be in harmony with the same elements of the surrounding historic buildings. 

(a) 
Setbacks and orientation. 

[1] New buildings should be sited on the lots corresponding to the setbacks of neighboring historic houses. 
[2] A new house should be sited in relation to the topography of the property following the example of the historic houses. 
[3] The front facade of a new house should face Bluff Road. 

(b) 
Rhythm of spacing of buildings. The rhythm of buildings and the spaces between which characterize the district should be maintained by the siting of a new house on its lot. 

(c) 
Scale. The scale of a new house and its features should be in harmony with the scale of the historic houses in the district. 

(d) 
Height. The height of a new house should be within the range of heights of the historic houses in the district. 

(e) 
Massing. The historic houses are predominantly simple forms with some complexity given by a cross gable, a recessed porch or dormer windows. The composition of a new house should correspond to the restrained complex massing of the historic houses. 

(f) 
Proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings. 




[1] The windows of a new house should generally be rectangular with a vertical proportion. 
[2] The arrangement of windows and doorways should produce a balanced facade. 
[3] The front facade and prominent side facades of new houses should have a ratio of door and window area to wall area similar to that of the historic residences. 
[4] A porch would enhance the overall compatibility with the historic district. 
(g) 
Roof form. New houses should have a roof form typical of that of surrounding historic houses. The historic houses have gable, gambrel or hip roofs with intersecting cross gables, eaves at different levels and dormer windows that give them a somewhat complex roofline. 

(h) 
Materials. The materials of a new building should be in harmony with the materials of the historic residences, all of which have wood shingle siding and painted wood trim. 

(i) 
Architectural details. The conservative use of decorative detail on new residences would enhance their compatibility with the historic houses in the district where the use of decorative elements is restrained. New work should also reflect the tradition of quality in materials and construction found in the details of the historic houses. 


§ B-8. for demolition. 
A. No building or structure or portion thereof that makes an important contribution to the district should be demolished. Exceptions to this rule may be granted by the Architectural Review Board only as follows. 
B. In considering a proposal to demolish a building or structure or portion of a building or structure the following guidelines apply: 
(1) 
The Architectural Review Board shall consider the historic and architectural significance of the building, the contribution the building makes to the historic district, and the impact of its removal on the character of the district. 

(2) 
If an application for demolition of an entire historic building is based on structural instability or deterioration, a technical report prepared by an architect or engineer is required. The report will detail the problems and provide cost estimates for their correction. 

(3) 
The Architectural Review Board may require adequate documentation of an historic building through photographs and measured drawings as a condition of approval when there is no alternative but demolition. 

(4) 
Before approval can be granted to demolish a building, the Architectural Review Board shall require that plans for proposed new construction or other use of the site be submitted and approved. 


§ B-9. Guidelines for relocation. 
A. The intent is to retain the historic buildings on their original sites. 
B. The houses on the level plateau at the east end of Bluff Road are each sited on their lot in a similar fashion. The regular rhythm of the houses and the spaces between them, along with the band of front lawns, are major features of the historic district. At the west end of Bluff Road the houses are perched at the top of the dune, a placement which contributes to the rural character of the road and to the relationship between these houses and the view to the Atlantic Ocean. 
C. With the careful siting on their lots, each historic house contributes to the setting of the 
§ B-9 EAST HAMPTON CODE § B-11 
neighboring houses and together they establish the larger setting of the historic district. 
(1) 
In considering a proposal to relocate a building, the Architectural Review Board will consider the historic and architectural significance of the building, the contribution the building makes to the historic district on its existing site, and the impact of its relocation on the character of the district. 

(2) 
Before approval can be granted to relocate a building, the Architectural Review Board shall require that plans for proposed new construction or other use of the site be submitted and approved. 


§ B-10. Guidelines when designation is limited to an access strip. 
A. The Bluff Road Historic District includes the access strips to three flag lots. These are: 
350 Bluff Road 360 Bluff Road 362 Bluff Road 
B. The main portion of these lots and the buildings on them are not in the district. The owners of these access strips are required to submit an application only for any fence, wall, gate or new driveway proposed within the designated access strip. 
§ B-11. Guidelines for public property. 
A. The nature of review for public property. Proposals for work to property owned by the Town of East Hampton will he submitted to the Architectural Review Board for their review. The Architectural Review Board will issue their findings in a report to the Town Board and to the official making the application. The report will explain how the proposal meets or does not meet the standards, criteria and guidelines that apply to the Bluff Road Historic District and will consider any alternatives to the proposal that would better meet those standards, criteria and guidelines. 
B. Bluff Road and public land. 
(1) 
Bluff Road and adjoining public land should be managed in a way that maintains or enhances the setting of the historic district. 

(2) 
Bluff Road and the double dune area owned by the Town of East Hampton are important components of the setting of the historic houses of the Bluff Road Historic District. 

(3) 
The rural character of Bluff Road, the natural vegetation (especially the Eastern red cedar, bayberry and wild cherry) and the vista across the dunes to the Atlantic are all important features of the historic district. 

(4) 
Early news show a much more open hedgerow on the south side of Bluff Road. This hedgerow has since become overgrown and now obscures much of the view from Bluff Road across the dunes to the ocean. 

(5) 
Alterations to public property subject to review by the Architectural Review Board 


include any plans to widen the road, install curbs, install a sidewalk, build a parking area, change the street lights, install any exterior lighting, install a fence or construct any building or structure within the district. 
(a) 
Any proposal should maintain or enhance the setting of the residences in the district. 

(b) 
The rural character of Bluff Road should be retained. The roadway should be maintained at its present width with no curbing. 

(c) 
The setting of the historic district should be enhanced by restoring views from Bluff Road across the dunes to the ocean by selectively clearing and pruning vegetation within the road right-of-way. 


C. Public buildings. 
(1) 
The district contains four public buildings associated with the Naval Direction-Finding Station which operated here from 1921 through World War II. This Station provided bearings for Naval and merchant vessels and was especially important during World War II when it intercepted transmissions from German ships and U-boats in the North Atlantic for the purpose of targeting their position for attacks by 

U.S. ships and planes. The Town Marine Museum was the barracks, built about 1942. The brick Donald W. Lamb Memorial Building was the transmitter building for the low-frequency direction-finding station, built about 1939. The concession stand at Atlantic Avenue Beach is on the foundation of the 1921 low-frequency direction-finding station and was rebuilt in 1984 to have the exterior form of the original. Behind the Marine Museum is the Station's guard house. 

(2) 
These buildings are significant for their associations with maritime and military history and are important as components of the setting of the summer cottages on Bluff Road. Because of the attempt to camouflage these buildings by giving them a residential appearance they are compatible with the character of the historic district. 

(3) 
The Marine Museum is especially compatible with the character of the district. Its simple gable-roofed form, entrance porch, windows with blinds, natural shingle siding and white trim give it a residential appearance in keeping with the character of the summer cottages. 

(4) 
Because of its small size and residential character, the Donald W. Lamb Memorial Building has a minimal impact on the setting of the historic houses. The addition to the south is not visible from Bluff Road. 

(5) 
The front lawns of these two buildings also contribute to the overall setting of the district. 

(6) 
The contribution these buildings make to the historic district and their compatibility with the setting of the historic houses should be maintained. 

(a) 
These properties should be maintained in a way that enhances their compatibility with the setting of the fourteen historic summer cottages. 

(b) 
The original features of these buildings should be maintained. 




§ B-11 EAST HAMPTON CODE § C-1 
(c) 
Any necessary addition to the Marine Museum or to the Donald W. Lamb Memorial Building should be located on the south side and should not be visible from Bluff Road. A second story should not be added to the Donald W. Lamb Memorial Building. 

(d) 
Features of the property that contribute to the setting of the historic district should be maintained. 


§ B-12. Nature preserves. 
A. The historic district contains approximately 100 aces of dune land which contribute to the setting of the summer cottages on Bluff Road. This intact natural setting maintains the relationship of the cottages to the Atlantic Ocean and recalls the wild and picturesque landscape that attracted the founders of Amagansett's summer colony. 
B. All of this land, with the exception of two parcels which contain residences, is owned by either the Town of East Hampton, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or The Nature Conservancy. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service parcel is designated the Amagansett National Wildlife Refuge and is included in a Parks and Conservation zoning district. Two parcels owned by the Town of East Hampton (172-11-18.1 and 172-11-20) are also in a Parks and Conservation zoning district. The two other parcels owned by the Town of East Hampton (190-2-16.1 and 190-2-17.2) and the eight parcels owned by The Nature Conservancy are included in an A2 Residence zoning district and are within The Atlantic Double Dunes Preserve. 
C. The goal of designating these parcels as the Amagansett National Wildlife Refuge, as a Parks and Conservation zoning district or as The Atlantic Double Dunes Preserve is to maintain the land in its natural state. The goal of the Bluff Road Historic District is to protect this natural landscape as the setting of the summer cottages. 
D. Any structure proposed to be placed on these properties is subject to review by the Architectural Review Board. 
Zoning Appendix C 
THE SPRINGS HISTORIC DISTRICT GUIDELINES 
[HISTORY: Added by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 3-18-2004 by L.L. No. 4-2004] § C-1. Location and composition of district. 
A. The Springs Historic District contains a mix of nineteenth-century farmhouses, barns, community buildings and commercial buildings in a rural setting. 
B. The group of intact historic buildings, which includes 10 vernacular farmhouses, four barns, the 1844 Springs General Store, the 1882 Springs Community Presbyterian Church, the 1884 Springs School (Ashawagh Hall) and the 1886 Charles Parsons Blacksmith Shop, represent many facets of life in this thriving agrarian community during the nineteenth century. 
C. Equally important to the historic buildings is their setting. Although the farms are no longer active and fields are overgrown, the barns, outbuildings and maintained clearings keep the rural landscape intact. The historic setting is especially vivid at the heart of the district with the triangular green at Ashawagh Hall, the Pussy's Pond preserve and the open farmyard and agricultural buildings of the Talmage-Miller House across Fireplace Road. This open setting maintains the relationships between the farmhouses, community buildings, country store and blacksmith shop. Also preserved are the important relationships of the nineteenth-century Springs Farm between farmhouse, barn, pastureland, woodland, salt meadow and the freshwater springs of Pussy's Pond. 
§ C-2. Preservation goals for The Springs Historic District. 
A. Maintain and enhance the elements that contribute to the overall setting: open yards and clearings, traditional fences along the road, visual connections between historic buildings and vistas to Accabonac Harbor. 
B. Maintain the architectural integrity of the historic buildings, especially of the front facades and other components visible from the road. 
C. Allow additions and other changes to rear walls and in appropriate ways to side walls to allow the historic buildings to be adapted to changing needs and lifestyles. 
D. Maintain the architectural integrity of the barns and other agricultural structures and the integrity of their setting. 
§ C-3. Summary of work that is exempt from review. 
A. Work that is exempt from review for a property with an historic single-family residence.

(15) 
Any minor repair where the purpose of the repair is to correct deterioration of a feature arid to restore that feature to its original condition. 


B. Work that is exempt from review for a property with a nonhistoric single-family residence: 
(1) 
All work listed above that is exempt for a property with an historic single-family residence. 

(2) 
Any work to the residence itself which does not require a building permit. 


§ C-4. Guidelines for site planing. 
A. Fences and walls. The horizontal-board fences and split-rail fences contribute to the open and rural character of The Springs Historic District. 
(1) 
Any fence along the front property line or in the front yard should contribute to the open character of the historic district. 

(2) 
Wood horizontal-board fences with two or three rails and wood split-rail fences with two or three rails less than four feet in height are exempt from review. 

(3) 
The following fences and walls would detract from the setting of the historic district and would be especially inappropriate along the front property line: 

(a) 
A solid board fence; 

(b) 
A chain link fence; and 

(c) 
A masonry wall. 




B. Grade changes, berms and retaining walls. 
(1) 
The natural topography is an important feature of The Springs Historic District. Farmland, pastureland, woodland and the Accabonac Harbor salt meadows were important to the nineteenth-century agrarian economy and are essential to the setting of The Springs Historic District. 

(2) 
Changing the grade and installing berms or retaining walls can affect the setting of the historic district. 

(a) 
Changing the grade so as to alter the natural topography is not appropriate in the historic district. 

(b) 
Berms and retaining walls are not appropriate in the historic district. 




C. Driveways, walkways and parking areas. The intent is to encourage paving that does not detract from the setting of the historic district, especially at parking areas for nonresidential properties. 
(1) 
A plan to install a new driveway or parking area will be reviewed for its impact on the setting of buildings in the district. 

(2) 
All walkways are exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 

(3) Resurfacing an existing driveway is exempt from review. 

D. 
Tennis courts, swimming pools, decks and terraces. A new tennis court, swimming pool, deck or terrace should not detract from the setting of the historic buildings. 

(1) 
A tennis court, or, swimming pool should not detract from the setting of the properties in the district. Therefore, the location of a swimming pool or tennis court on the property is the principal concern. 

(2) 
Swimming pools and tennis courts should be located to the rear of the residence and not be visible from the road. 

(3) 
Decks and terraces will be reviewed for their location and impact on the setting and architectural integrity of an historic building and the setting of other properties in the district. A deck or terrace on the rear wall of a residence is exempt from review. 



E. 
Exterior lighting. Lighting on nonresidential properties can affect the setting of the residences. 

(1) 
Exterior lighting is exempt from review for a property with a single-family residence. 

(2) 
Exterior lighting on other properties should be appropriate to the rural character of the historic district and compatible with the residential areas of the district. Light fixtures should be sited to prevent glare or reflection onto adjacent properties. 




§ C-5. Guidelines for historic buildings. 
A. Work to the rear wall of a single-family residence that does not require a building permit is exempt from review. Any work to the rear wall of a single-family residence that does not require a building permit is exempt from review. 
B. Wall material. 
(1) 
The intent is to retain appropriate exterior materials, especially wood shingles. 

(2) 
Wood shingled exteriors predominate on the historic buildings and make a major contribution to the cohesive character of The Springs Historic District. The Parsons Blacksmith Shop has vertical-board siding and Ashawagh Hall has a stucco exterior. 

(a) 
Historic buildings with wood shingles, clapboards or vertical-board siding should retain these treatments. 

(b) 
Replacing wood shingles with new wood shingles is exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 

(c) 
Any other proposal to renew the siding on a building requires review. 




C. Roof material. Roof material is not a critical factor in the historic district. 
(1) 
Roof material is exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 

(2) 
Gutters and leaders are exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 


D. Doorways. 
§ C-5 EAST HAMPTON CODE § C-5 
(1) 
The intent is to retain original front doorways that contribute to the historic character of a building. 

(2) 
Among the rural farmhouses of this district, a simple entrance, such as that of the Abraham King House at 791 Fireplace Road, is as important as a more decorative entrance; such as the Greek Revival doorway of the Jonathan Ambrose Parsons House (Anderson House). 

(a) 
Review is required for any proposal to replace a door or components of a door enframement. 

(b) 
All significant elements of an original front doorway, including the door, should be retained and repaired instead of replaced. If replacement of any component is necessary, the new material should match that being replaced. 

(c) 
Installing a storm/screen door at any doorway is exempt from review. 

(d) 
For any single-family residence, installing an access to a door for the physically handicapped is exempt from review. 




E. Windows. 
(1) 
The intent is to retain original windows that contribute to the historic character of a building, especially on the front facade. 

(2) 
A large number of the historic buildings retain the original windows and window sash. These are primarily the six-light sash of the Greek Revival period and the two-light sash of the Victorian era. These intact windows make a significant contribution to the architectural character and to the sense of authenticity of the historic district. 

(a) 
Windows and their trim that contribute to the historic character of a building should be retained where reasonably feasible, as set forth below. 

(b) 
For any request to replace window components the Architectural Review Board will consider the contribution the existing windows make to the historic character of the building. Replacement components for important windows, especially those on the front wall or another prominent wall, should match the material, configuration and dimensions of the original. 

(c) 
When a window is deteriorated and needs to be replaced, the Board will work with the homeowner to find the best replacement at a reasonable cost. 

(d) 
Storm windows, window screens and window shutters are exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 

(e) 
Installing a skylight requires review. 




F. Porches. 
(1) 
The intent is to retain original porches that contribute to the historic character of a building. 

(2) 
Front porches are important features of some of the Victorian-era farmhouses in the district such as the Julius Parsons House at 803 Fireplace Road and the Pollock-


Krasner House. 
(a) 
Removing, replacing or installing a porch or porch posts, columns, balustrades, brackets, and other important components requires review. Deteriorated components should be replaced in kind. 

(b) 
Repair or replacement of porch steps, porch flooring and railings to porch steps are exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 


G. Paint. Most historic buildings in the district retain the traditional color schemes of unpainted shingle siding with white trim or white siding with white trim. These two traditional color schemes are an important unifying feature of the district and contribute to the rural character. 
(1) 
Paint is exempt from review for a single-family residence or a church. 

(2) 
The following guidelines apply to other properties: 

(a) 
Historic buildings with either natural shingle siding or with shingle or clapboard siding painted white should retain those treatments. 

(b) 
Paint colors should be appropriate to the period and style of the building. 




H. Other structures in the District. 
(1) 
The intent is to retain the historic agricultural structures that contribute to the character of the district. 

(2) 
The surviving barns and sheds are essential reminders of the agrarian history of The Springs. The Charles Parsons Blacksmith Shop is also part of this heritage. These structures are among the most valuable in the district; they should be retained and their historic and architectural integrity kept intact. 


I. Additions and alterations. 
(1) 
Additions and alterations are appropriate when they do not diminish the architectural integrity or the setting of a building. 

(2) 
Additions and alterations should not alter an important historic feature of a building and should be compatible with the historic character of the building and the district. 

(a) 
The addition or alteration should be compatible with the historic building and with the character of the district in scale, height, massing, proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings, roof form, texture, materials and architectural details. 

(b) 
Additions should be subordinate in scale to the historic building. 

(c) 
Additions set back on the rear wall are encouraged. 

(d) 
Additions to a side wall are appropriate when they are secondary to the historic house. A side addition should be set back from the front wall of the historic house and be subordinate in size and scale to the historic house. 

(e) 
Flexibility is required in reviewing additions and alterations to rear walls and to 




§ C-5 EAST HAMPTON CODE § C-7 
secondary side walls of houses where installation of doors, windows, and additions with more glazing that found in the historic house can be expected. 
§ C-6. Guidelines for nonhistoric buildings. 
A. Buildings that are less than 50 years old are classified as nonhistoric buildings. 
B. In The Springs Historic District are six properties with nonhistoric houses. This classification is made in the historic district designation report. These six properties are: 753 Fireplace Road; 771 Fireplace Road; 814 Fireplace Road; 818 Fireplace Road; 825 Fireplace Road; and 21 Old Stone Highway. 
C. These guidelines also apply to accessory buildings that are less than 50 years old. 
D. Many of the nonhistoric houses and accessory buildings are set well back on their lots where they have little impact on the setting of the district. The plantings of an overgrown pasture, an informal mix of cedar trees and native deciduous trees, provide an appropriate screen for some of these buildings. 
E. The intent of review of these nonhistoric buildings is to see that any changes do not detract from the setting of an historic building and do not diminish the character of the historic district. Therefore, any proposed changes to a nonhistoric building should be judged for their compatibility with neighboring historic buildings and with the character of the road and district in general. 
F. Because most work on a nonhistoric building would have little or no effect on the historic district, these guidelines attempt to make the process as streamlined as possible. 
(1) 
Any work to a nonhistoric building which does not require a building permit is exempt from review. 

(2) 
Any work requiring a building permit is subject to review and will be judged by the principles of compatibility in § 255-7-60 of the East Hampton Town Code and amplified in the following "Guidelines for New Construction." 

(3) 
In reviewing applications for nonhistoric buildings, the degree to which proposed changes will be visible from adjacent historic properties and from the road will be taken into account. Priority will be given to the compatibility of the most visible features of the proposed new addition or alteration. 

(4) 
Any addition or alteration to a nonhistoric building may be in the style of that building. 


§ C-7. Guidelines for new construction. 
A. Accessory buildings. 
(1) 
Location and plans for accessory buildings, such as garages, sheds and pool houses, will be reviewed. Generally these buildings should be sited to the rear of the main building and be compatible with the main building, its setting and with neighboring buildings. 

(2) 
In reviewing applications for accessory buildings, the degree to which the proposed 


building will be visible from adjacent historic properties and from the road will be taken into account. Priority will be given to the compatibility of the most visible features of the proposed new building. 
B. Principal buildings. 
(1) 
New buildings should be compatible with the historic buildings and with the character of the historic district, Section 255-7-60B of the East Hampton Town Code provides criteria for judging the compatibility of new construction. These criteria, which are amplified below, define the basic design elements which establish the character of the historic district. The design elements of a new building should be in harmony with the same elements of the surrounding historic buildings. 

(2) 
The builders of some of the recent houses within The Springs Historic District took advantage of the overgrown pasture landscape and set the new construction back from the road where it would be screened by the native vegetation. This practice has worked well in the rural context of this district. 

(3) 
In reviewing applications for new construction, the degree to which the proposed building will be visible from adjacent historic properties and from the road will be taken into account. Priority will be given to the compatibility of the most visible features of the proposed new building. 

(4) 
Setbacks and orientation. 

(a) 
New buildings should be sited on their lots to best maintain the setting of neighboring historic buildings. 

(b) 
The front facade of a new building should face the road. 



(5) 
Rhythm of spacing of buildings. 

(a) The rhythm of buildings and the spaces between which characterize the district should be maintained by the siting of a new building on its lot. 

(6) 
Scale. scale of a new building and its features should be in harmony with the scale of the historic residences in the district. 

(7) 
Height. The height of a new residence should be within the range of heights of the historic residences in the district. 

(8) 
Massing. New buildings should employ the traditional simple forms prevalent in the district. 

(9) 
Proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings. 

(a) 
The windows of a new building should generally be rectangular with a vertical proportion. 

(b) 
The arrangement of windows and doorways should produce a balanced facade. 

(c) 
The front facade and prominent side facades of new buildings should have a ratio of door and window area to wall area similar to that of the historic residences. 




§ C-7 EAST HAMPTON CODE § C-9 
(10) 
Roof form. New buildings should have a roof form typical of that of surrounding historic buildings. The roof slope should be within the range established by the historic roofs. Secondary components of some historic buildings have shed roofs. 

(11) 
Materials. The materials of a new building should be in harmony with the materials of the historic residences. Wood shingles are an appropriate siding material. Painted wood doors, windows and trim would enhance the harmony of materials. 

(12) 
Architectural details. The conservative use of decorative detail on new residences would enhance their compatibility with the historic houses in the district where the use of decorative elements is restrained. 


§ C-8. Guidelines for demolishing a building or removing it from the district. 
A. No building or structure or portion thereof that makes an important contribution to the district should be demolished or moved out of the district. Exceptions to this rule may be granted by the Architectural Review Board only as follows. 
B. In considering a proposal to demolish a building or portion of a building or to move a building out of the district the following guidelines apply. 
(1) 
The Architectural Review Board shall consider the historic and architectural significance of the building, the contribution the building makes to the historic district, and the impact of its removal on the character of the district. 

(2) 
Nonhistoric buildings may be demolished or moved out of the district. 

(3) 
If an application for demolition of an historic building is based on structural instability or deterioration, a technical report prepared by an architect or engineer is required. The report will detail the problems and provide cost estimates for their correction. 

(4) 
The Architectural Review Board may require adequate documentation of an historic building through photographs and measured drawings as a condition of approval when there is no alternative but demolition. 

(5) 
Before approval can be granted to demolish a building or move a building out of the district, the Architectural Review Board shall require plans for proposed new construction or other use of the site be submitted and approved. 


§ C-9. Guidelines for relocating a building on its lot. 
A. The character of the district is established by the traditional placement of the historic residences on their lots and by the resulting visual relationships between them. Historic buildings that make an important contribution to the district should remain on their original sites. 
B. Exception to this rule may be granted by the Architectural Review Board only as follows. 
C. In considering a proposal to relocate a building on its present lot the following guidelines apply: 
(1) The rhythm of the road and the visual relationships between buildings should be maintained. 
(2) The Board will consider the historic and architectural significance of the building, the contribution the building makes to the historic district at its present location and the impact of its proposed relocation on the character of the district. The Board will take into account the setbacks of other historic houses in the district which remain on their original sites. 
§ C-10. Guidelines when designation is limited to an access strip. 
A. The Springs Historic District includes the access strips to five flag lots. These are: 755 Fireplace Road; 757 Fireplace Road; 775 Fireplace Road; 777 Fireplace Road; and 815 Fireplace Road. 
B. The main portion of these lots and the buildings on them are not in the district. The owners of these access strips are required to submit an application only for any fence, wall, gate or new driveway proposed within the designated access strip. 
§ C-11. Guidelines for public property. 
A. The nature of review for public property. Proposals for work to property owned by the Town of East Hampton will be submitted to the Architectural Review Board for their review. The Architectural Review Board will issue their findings in a report to the Town Board and to the official making the application. The report will explain how the proposal meets or does not meet the standards, criteria and guidelines that apply to The Springs Historic District and will consider any alternatives to the proposal that would better meet those standards, criteria and guidelines. 
B. Fireplace Road, Old Stone Highway and public land. 
(1) 
Fireplace Road, Old Stone Highway and the public land of the Pussy's Pond Nature Preserve and the Anderson House parcel should be managed in a way that maintains or enhances the setting of the historic district. 

(2) 
The land which is now Pussy's Pond Nature Preserve along with the parcel containing the Jonathan Ambrose Parsons House (Anderson House) and Blacksmith Shop was the farm of Jonathan Ambrose Parsons and George Ambrose Parsons from the early 19th century into the early 20th century. This farm had pastureland, water for livestock in the spring-fed Pussy's Pond and salt meadows. These were the major resources of the important faiths of The Springs. 

(3) 
The success of this farm is well expressed by the house Jonathan Ambrose Parsons built in 1842 (Anderson House) with its substantial size, Greek Revival form and elaborate doorway. 

(4) 
The historic setting of the Parsons House has diminished as the abandoned pastureland has become overgrown with cedars and native deciduous trees and the upper pond has become filled in. 

(5) 
Enhancing the relationship between the Parsons House (Anderson House), Pussy's Pond and the Parsons farm pastureland would greatly increase the ability of the Parsons House to evoke the agrarian history of The Springs. 

(6) 
The open setting provided by the triangular green at Ashawagh Hall and the resulting 


§ C-11 EAST HAMPTON CODE § C-12 
visual connections between buildings gives the heart of the district its vivid historic character. More openness, especially at the Parsons House (Anderson House) lot and at the north end of Pussy's Pond preserve would further enhance the visual relationships between historic buildings and provide more of an agrarian setting. 
(7) Alterations to public property subject to review by the Architectural Review Board include any plans to widen the road, install curbs, install a sidewalk, build a parking area, change the street lights, install any exterior lighting, install a fence or construct any building or structure within the district. 
(a) 
Any proposal should maintain or enhance the setting of the historic buildings in the district. 

(b) 
The rural character of Fireplace Road and Old Stone Highway should be retained. The roadway should be maintained at its present width with no curbing or shoulders. 

(c) 
The historic district should be enhanced by creating a more open setting, especially at the Jonathan Ambrose Parsons House (Anderson House) lot and at the north end of Pussy's Pond preserve. 


C. Public Buildings. The Town property includes the 1842 Jonathan Ambrose Parsons House (Anderson House); the 1886 Charles Parsons Blacksmith Shop, moved to this site from another property in the district in 1983; and a nonhistoric studio located behind the Anderson House. 
(1) 
The Jonathan Ambrose Parsons House is among the most important historic buildings in the district. It retains a high level of architectural integrity with many original features, including the Greek Revival front entrance, windows with six-light sash, and the kitchen ell. 

(2) 
The historic significance of the Charles Parsons Blacksmith Shop has long been recognized. When the future of the blacksmith shop was threatened the Town moved it to this site and subsequently restored the building. The Parsons Blacksmith Shop, where farm implements were manufactured and maintained, also makes an important contribution to the rural and agrarian character of the district. 

(3) 
The architectural integrity of the Jonathan Ambrose Parsons House and the Charles Parsons Blacksmith Shop should be maintained. 


§ C-12. The Nature Conservancy Preserves. 
The Nature Conservancy owns two groups of contiguous parcel in the district which extend from Accabonac Harbor. 
A. Adjacent to The Springs Community Presbyterian Church the Conservancy owns approximately 3.1 acres extending from Fireplace Road to Accabonac "Harbor. This preserve is at a critical location adjacent to the church, cemetery, and creek to Pussy's Pond and across the road from the intact farmhouse and fields at 803 Fireplace Road (Julius D. Parsons House). Vistas from these properties to Accabonac Harbor are important to the setting of the historic district and maintain the historic connection between this settlement and Accabonac Harbor. 
B. A preserve of approximately three acres extends from the Pollack-Krasner House property to Accabonac Harbor. The open vista across salt meadows to the harbor is important to the setting of this National Historic Landmark. 
Zoning Appendix D 
MONTAUK ASSOCIATION HISTORIC DISTRICT GUIDELINES 
[HISTORY: Added by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 10-19-2004 by L.L. No. 30-2004] § D-1. Background. 
A. The Montauk Association was established in 1881 by Arthur Benson and a group of his friends as a private summer sporting retreat. Frederick Law Olmsted drew a site plan for the Association grounds of more than one hundred acres which were at that time open pastureland. Olmsted laid out roadways following the natural topography and precisely located house sites in the rolling terrain where each house could take full advantage of ocean views and ocean breezes and be surrounded by ample open space. 
B. Seven of the original owners built houses between 1882 and 1884, all of which were designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White. These seven houses and a clubhouse, by the same architects, were built on the sites specified by Olmsted along the ridge just north of DeForest Road. 
C. The Montauk Association houses are notable works by McKim, Mead & White during that important period in the early 1880s when their inventive and original work contributed to what we now know as the Shingle Style, a distinctive American architecture. These houses represent the application of McKim, Mead & White's ideas in a simplified and restrained way to vacation houses of a modest scale. McKim, Mead & White's greatest achievement at Montauk was the design of a cohesive group of seven houses where each was distinct but where none stood out as being more important than its neighbor. 
D. The modest scale and informal design of the houses complement Olmsted's rambling layout, the remote pastureland setting on the Atlantic bluff, and the owners' intent to enjoy a simple, sporting life at Montauk. 
E. Shingle-style houses showed an appreciation of New England colonial architecture and this is especially true in the gable-roof forms and shingled walls of the Montauk Association houses. The houses not only related to the landscape but also to Montauk's First House, Second House and Third House. 
F. The Montauk Association is a model historic district where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The houses and landscape are bound together as one creative work. Only the whole ensemble can convey the full meaning and significance of McKim, Mead & White's architecture, Olmsted's landscape plan and the owners' intentions. Today the houses retain a high level of architectural integrity and the setting is largely intact. Maintaining the integrity of the setting is equally as important as maintaining the integrity of each of the seven original houses. 
G. The Orr House was destroyed by fire in 1997 and was reconstructed in 2000. The reconstruction, substantiated by documentary and physical evidence, successfully re-
§ D-1 EAST HAMPTON CODE § D-3 
created the appearance of the Orr House in materials, design, color and texture. Because it is an accurate reconstruction of an important component of the whole ensemble, the Orr House is considered an historic building within the context of the Montauk Association Historic District. 
H. The Montauk Association Historic District Designation Report further describes the individual properties and the character of the historic district. 
I. These guidelines recognize the very high level of historic and architectural significance of the Montauk Association and accordingly set high standards for preserving the historic houses and their setting. 
§ D-2. Preservation goals. 
A. Maintain the architectural integrity of the seven original houses; retain original features and materials. 
B. Encourage the accurate restoration of missing features. 
C. Allow modest additions and other changes to north walls to allow the seven historic houses to be adapted to changing needs and lifestyles, provided that important original features are not affected. 
D. Protect the setting of the historic houses and their relationships to one another and to the environment by controlling new construction and alterations to nonhistoric houses. 
E. The siting of any new house should conform to the character of open space, the relationship to the natural topography and the rhythm of houses and open space evident in the 1881 Olmsted plan and in the siting of the historic houses. 
F. The siting of any new house should not detract from the spacious setting of an historic house or interrupt vistas from the historic houses and the Clubhouse Site to the Atlantic Ocean or vistas from one historic property to another. 
G. Any new house should have a restrained design and should defer to the seven original houses as the focal buildings of the district. 
§ D-3. Guidelines for site planning. 
A. Fences and walls. The open, flowing landscape retains the historic relationships of the houses to one another and to the environment. This open setting is maintained in part by the lack of obtrusive fencing. 
(1) 
Fences around gardens and swimming pools are appropriate. Generally, swimming pool fencing should enclose the area of the pool itself rather than incorporate a large area of the property. Appropriate fencing for gardens and swimming pools includes post-and-rail fences, wood picket fences and wire fences with wood posts, all not greater than four feet in height. 

(2) 
Boundary fences and yard fences would detract from the setting of the historic district by interrupting the flow of the land. 

(3) 
Low masonry walls may be appropriate for enclosing small gardens or terraces. 

(4) 
The following fences and walls would detract from the setting of the historic district and would be inappropriate: a solid board fence; a chain link fence; or a masonry wall that exceeds three feet in height. 

(5) 
Entrance gates can obstruct the open setting. Any necessary entrance gate should intrude as little as possible on the open, informal and natural setting. Appropriate gate posts include plain, unpainted wood timbers or wood poles. Unpainted horizontal-board gates are appropriate. 



B. 
Grade changes, berms and retaining walls. An appreciation of the natural topography underlies Olmsted's plan for the house sites, roads and paths of the Montauk Association. Changing the grade and installing berms or retaining walls can affect the setting of the houses, their relationship with one another, their relationship to the environment and the sense of the natural topography. 

(1) 
Changing the grade so as to alter the natural topography of a property is not appropriate in the historic district. 

(2) 
Berms and retaining walls are not appropriate in the historic district. 



C. 
Roads, driveways and parking areas. DeForest Road, the principal road laid out by Olmsted, follows the natural contours under the ridge of the owners' houses. The unpaved DeForest Road and other original roadways, including the loop drive to the Clubhouse site, remain in their original condition and make an important contribution to the natural and informal setting of the historic district. The narrow, unpaved driveways also maintain this informal character. 

(1) 
A plan to install a new road or driveway or a plan to widen or resurface an existing road or driveway will be reviewed for its impact on the setting of the historic district. 

(2) 
Original roads and paths laid out by Olmsted should be maintained in their existing or original state. 

(3) 
Any necessary new driveways should continue the precedent of the existing narrow, unpaved driveways which follow the natural contours of the land. 

(4) 
Asphalt and masonry-block surfaces for roads, driveways and parking areas would detract from the setting of the historic district and are inappropriate unless they are necessary for a stable surface due to a sloping grade. 

(5) 
Parking areas should be sited at least a short distance from the house, be located by a secondary facade and require little or no adjustment of the natural topography. 

(6) 
Normal maintenance of an existing unpaved road or driveway is exempt from review. 



D. 
Swimming pools . 

(1) 
The historic district contains swimming pools set away from the houses and integrated into the landscape. New swimming pools which follow this model can be compatible with the setting of the historic district. 

(2) 
A swimming pool should be located where it will not detract from the historic setting. The pool should be located away from the house at a site where it can be set into the natural landscape. The proposed location should require only minimal grading and 




§ D-3 EAST HAMPTON CODE § D-4 
screening. 
E. Tennis courts. 
(1) 
There are no tennis courts in the Montauk Association Historic District. It would be difficult to integrate a tennis court or other playing court that requires a large, hard, level surface into the natural landscape of the historic district. A tennis court would be a structure with a larger footprint than any of the historic houses in the district. Such a large feature, with the grading and fencing that would be associated with it, would detract from the open, natural setting of the district. 

(2) 
Tennis courts and other similar playing courts are not appropriate in the historic district. 


F. Decks and terraces. The seven historic cottages retain their original setting with lawn flowing up to the house. The outdoor living spaces are porches or lawn. Most of the nonhistoric houses have a similar setting. The few decks and terraces that exist in the historic district are minor features. 
(1) 
Decks and terraces will be reviewed for their impact on the setting of the historic houses and on the natural setting of the historic district. 

(2) 
A deck or terrace is not appropriate adjacent to a principal facade of an historic house. 

(3) 
A minor deck or terrace may be appropriate adjacent to a secondary facade of an historic house or adjacent to a nonhistoric house. 

(4) 
A small terrace at a swimming pool may be appropriate providing only minimal grading is necessary. 


G. Exterior lighting. The restrained use of outdoor lighting helps to maintain the historic relationship between the houses and the natural environment. Existing lighting is primarily confined to incandescent fixtures within porches. 
(1) 
Porches and doorways are appropriate locations for light fixtures. Fixtures should use incandescent bulbs (60 watts maximum). 

(2) 
Site lighting should be confined to not more than three lanterns to illuminate driveways or parking areas. Fixtures should use incandescent bulbs (60 watts maximum). 


§ D-4. Guidelines for original Montauk Association Houses. 
These guidelines apply to the seven original Montauk Association houses: Agnew House, 101 DeForest Road; Benson House, 115 DeForest Road; Sanger House, 123 DeForest Road; Hoyt House, 129 DeForest Road; Andrews House, 153 DeForest Road; de Forest House, 167 DeForest Road; and Orr House, 181 DeForest Road. 
A. Preserving original materials. Because these houses possess an extremely high level of historic and architectural significance, a principal goal of the historic district is to retain original materials. 
(1) 
Intact original materials should not be removed. 

(2) 
Deteriorated original materials should be repaired rather than replaced. 

(3) 
When severe deterioration makes replacement necessary, the new material should be an exact match of the original. 



B. 
Restoring original features. 

(1) 
Recent owners have undertaken a program to restore their houses by replacing missing original features. Encouraging accurate restoration is a goal of the historic district. 

(2) 
Replacement of missing features or materials should be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 



C. 
Wall material. The wall material is an important character-defining feature of these Shingle Style houses. The Benson House is entirely shingled while the other six houses have a clapboard first story with shingled walls above. The shingle cover has great variety and includes diamond, fish scale, chisel, saw tooth and staggered shingle patterns. Today only the Agnew House retains original shingles. These are eighteen-inch Atlantic white cedar shingles which have a smooth surface. Other houses have replacement shingles which for the most part match the original shingle coursing and patterns. Historic photographs along with salvaged original shingles provide a good record of the original shingle treatments. Some of the houses retain original clapboards. Others have replacement clapboards which match the exposure and dimensions of the originals. 

(1) 
Original shingles should be retained. If replacement is necessary, new shingles should match the existing in material, surface texture, dimensions and pattern. 

(2) 
If nonhistoric shingles need to be replaced, new shingles should match the original shingles as closely as possible in material, surface texture, dimensions and pattern as substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 

(3) 
Original clapboards should be retained. A clapboard wall should be repaired by piecing in Dutchmen or new clapboards rather than wholesale replacement. 

(4) 
If clapboards are deteriorated and need to be replaced, new clapboards should match the existing in material, surface texture, dimensions and exposure. 



D. 
Roof material. The roofs are an important design element of the Montauk Association houses with their defining gables and secondary dormers, towers, cross gables and eaves at varying levels. Although none of the houses retains the original roof shingles, six of the seven houses have cedar shingle roofs which match the coursing of the original roofs. 

(1) 
Roofs should be clad with eighteen-inch cedar shingles. 

(2) 
In reviewing a proposal for a composition shingle roof the Board will consider the importance of the roof to the design of the house and the relationship of the roofing to other proposed work. Composition shingle roofs should have shingles of a rectangular design, a small scale, and a uniform gray tone no lighter than the color of weathered wood shingles. 



E. 
Chimneys. Chimneys are an important design element of the cottages, each of which has its own distinctive chimney. The different treatments include pilastered stacks, different 


§ D-4 EAST HAMPTON CODE § D-4 
corbelled caps, dovecote hoods and the shingles wrapping around the exterior stack of the Hoyt House. This variety contributes to the informal character of this group of houses. 
(1) 
Any proposal to remove or take down and rebuild a chimney requires review. 

(2) 
Original chimneys should be retained. If rebuilding is necessary, the existing brick and mortar joints should be matched. 


F. Gutters and leaders . 
(1) 
The Montauk Association houses originally had wood gutters or half-round metal gutters and round metal leaders that directed rainwater from the roofs into cisterns where it could be used as part of the domestic water supply. Most of the houses today have half-round copper gutters and round copper leaders. 

(2) 
Wood gutters or half-round metal gutters and round metal leaders are appropriate. Copper, lead-coated copper or galvanized steel are appropriate for metal gutters and leaders. 


G. Doorways. The wide Dutch entry doors of most of the houses are a hallmark of McKim, Mead & White's Shingle Style houses and convey the open relationship between the interior, the porch and the environment. 
(1) 
Review is required for any proposal to replace a door or components of a door enframement. 

(2) 
All significant elements of an original doorway, including the door, should be retained and repaired instead of replaced. 

(3) 
If replacement of any component is necessary, the new material should match that being replaced. 

(4) 
Installing a storm/screen door at any doorway is exempt from review. 


H. Windows The variety of window sashes which include different configurations of multipane sash and "Queen Anne sash" (a large single pane surrounded by a border of small panes) contributes to the informal nature of the houses. The house designs are also enlivened with distinctive window types such as the large stair hall windows, the triple-hung windows opening to porches, wheel windows, eyebrow windows and stained glass windows. 
(1) 
Original window casings and any decorative trim should be retained. If replacement is necessary, the new material should be an exact match of the existing material. 

(2) 
Original window sash should be retained. For any request to replace original window sash with new sash the Board will consider the following: 

(a) 
The contribution the window sash make to the historic character of the house and the condition of the sash. 

(b) 
Replacement sash should match the material, configuration and dimensions of all components of the original sash. 



(3) 
Storm windows and window screens are exempt from review. 

I. 
Window shutters. All the houses originally had louvered window shutters which were an essential functioning component of the summer cottage. During the day the shutters blocked rays from the sun while allowing the ocean breezes to cool the rooms. Today only the Benson House has shutters. 

(1) 
Plans to remove, replace, or install window shutters require review. 

(2) 
Plans to replace missing shutters should be based on documentary and physical evidence. 



J. 
Porches. The many porches are one of the principal character-defining features of these Shingle Style houses. The porches convey the relationship of the houses to the environment and to the Atlantic Ocean. All the houses have broad porches across the front facade, many of which wrap around the side walls or have projecting bays. The Andrews House and the Benson House have second-story sleeping porches. The porches feature a variety of turned posts and boxed posts, spindle screens, brackets, open balustrades and shingled balustrades. 

(1) 
Original porches and their posts, balustrades and brackets should be retained. If replacement is necessary, the new material should be an exact match of the existing material. 

(2) 
Replacement of missing porch components should be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 



K. 
Paint and stain. Queen Anne and early Shingle Style houses were painted or stained, often with complex schemes involving several colors. Evidence of the original paint schemes of the Montauk Association houses is provided by: traces of paint and stain on original shingles, clapboards and woodwork; historic photographs; and by early watercolors of the houses by W.L. Andrews and Eloise Payne Luquer (see Designation Report). Colors used to paint wood trim and clapboards included dark green, dark red and reddish-brown. Some of the houses also had stained shingles giving them a completely colored exterior. On the Agnew House, for example, the clapboards and window sash were red and the shingles and window trim were green. The Andrews House had clapboards stained a reddish-brown and green painted trim. Today all shingles are natural. On some houses the woodwork is painted white and on others it is painted a color. Because of the variety of colors employed in early Shingle Style houses and the variety of colors on the Montauk Association houses today, there is a considerable range of appropriate colors. 

(1) 
Painting wood trim and clapboards a color associated with the early Shingle Style is appropriate. Because of its prevalence today, white is also an appropriate color for wood trim. 

(2) 
Staining wood shingles a color associated with the early Shingle Style is appropriate. Leaving shingles natural is also appropriate. 

(3) 
Any proposal to remove exterior paint requires review. The method causing the least harm to the wood should be used. 



L. 
Additions and alterations. A principal goal of the historic district is to preserve the integrity of the original design of these highly significant houses. Because of their orientation to the Atlantic Ocean, to the Clubhouse and to each other, these houses do not have primary "front" and secondary "side" facades. The south, east and west walls of these houses are all 


§ D-4 EAST HAMPTON CODE § D-5 
important character-defining facades that were carefully designed by McKim, Mead & White. Additions to and alterations of these walls would diminish the architectural integrity of these houses. The Agnew House, the Sanger House, the Hoyt House and the Orr House had original small service wings extending from the north wall. These service wings are clearly secondary to the main house in their size and scale and in their plain design. 
(1) 
There should be no additions to the south, east or west walls of these houses. There should be no alterations to these walls except for the restoration of missing features. 

(2) 
The original service wings designed by McKim, Mead & White serve as precedents for proposed additions to the north wall. An addition to the north wall should be: stepped back from the side walls; modest in size and scale; secondary in character; and compatible in massing, proportion, arrangement of windows and other openings, roof form, texture and materials. It is appropriate for an addition to be subtly differentiated from the original house. An addition should not alter an important historic feature of the north wall, such as a stair hall window. 

(3) 
Any proposed alteration should not destroy a historic feature that characterizes the house, diminish the architectural integrity of the house or diminish the setting of the historic district. 

(4) 
If a building program requires floor area greater than what can be accommodated by the historic house and a modest north addition, the option of placing some requirements in a separate building must be considered. 


§ D-5. Guidelines for clubhouse site. 
A. These guidelines apply to the site of the original Montauk Association Clubhouse, 139 DeForest Road. The 1882 Clubhouse was the center of activity and was where the Association residents most often dined. The Clubhouse occupied a central position along the ridge, with four houses to the west and three to the east. The entrance of each house was oriented toward the Clubhouse, and a path led from each house directly to the Clubhouse. 
(1) 
The Clubhouse was positioned at the north edge of a hillock. An expansive lawn flowed out from the porch toward the Atlantic and a large rear wing extended down the back slope. 

(2) 
The Clubhouse burned in 1933. The present house at 139 DeForest Road was built in 1962 about 10 feet south of the Clubhouse foundation. The 1962 house retains the exact orientation of the Clubhouse. 

(3) 
The most significant historic feature of this site today is the large lawn terrace where Association members gathered. This central clearing is now the best reminder of the once-open pastureland setting of the Montauk Association. Because of this lawn terrace, and despite the loss of the Clubhouse, this is considered an historic property. These historic district guidelines take into account protecting the setting of the lawn terrace and vistas from the terrace to the Atlantic and to the historic houses as well as vistas from the historic houses to the lawn terrace. 

(4) 
Also remaining on the property is the brick wall of a Clubhouse service yard. A 1962 survey shows the outline of the Clubhouse foundation which was apparently extant at 


§ D-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § D-5 
that time; it is not known how much of this foundation remains below grade. 
(5) This is a key property and its redevelopment could have a major impact on the setting of the historic district. 
B. The following guidelines supplement the other pertinent guidelines in this manual: 
(1) 
In order to preserve the lawn terrace, one of the most important landscape features in the district, a new house or an expansion of the existing house should not be sited much further south on the lawn terrace than the location of the existing house. 

(2) 
This site has a special circumstance for new construction because of the large size of the original Clubhouse. A proposal to reconstruct the Clubhouse or to construct a new house that fits into the district in the same way the Clubhouse did may be entertained by the Architectural Review Board. Consideration of such a proposal must begin with an understanding of how the Clubhouse contributed to the ensemble of the Montauk Association. The Clubhouse consisted of a prominent, modest-sized front block which stood at the very north edge of the expansive lawn terrace and contributed to the setting of the Association in the same manner as the smaller of the Association houses. A large rear wing with a much lower roof and a plain exterior extended from the rear wall of the front block down a slope. The rear wing was clearly secondary in character and designed to be unobtrusive. It is not possible to know the exact size of the original Clubhouse without further research and analysis. It appears the front block had a footprint of approximately 2,000 square feet and a floor area on two floors of approximately 3,000 square feet The original rear wing may have had a footprint of approximately 3,000 square feet and a floor area on two floors of approximately 6,000 square feet. 

(a) 
The "Guidelines for New Construction" in this manual indicate that a new residence or an expanded nonhistoric residence should have a maximum size of 5,000 square feet. For a proposal for new construction or for expansion of the existing residence that does not exceed this guideline for maximum size the "Guidelines for New Construction" in this manual apply. 

(b) 
For a proposal to construct a new residence on this site that exceeds the guideline for maximum size (5,000 square feet) the following special guidelines take precedence: 




[1] A thorough consideration of the available documentary and physical evidence of the original Clubhouse must be undertaken with the assistance of the Architectural Review Board before any building is designed. 
[2] The new building must occur entirely within the exact footprint of the original Clubhouse. 
[3] The new building must have a front block that occupies the exact site of the front block of the Clubhouse and that is not larger than or higher than the front block of the Clubhouse and matches the massing, roof form, materials and the proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings of the front block of the Clubhouse. 
[4] Any additional area must occur in a rear wing that descends the north slope 
§ D-5 EAST HAMPTON CODE § D-8 
of the terrace that is not larger than or higher than the rear wing of the Clubhouse and matches the massing, roof form, materials, plain character and the proportion and arrangement of windows of the rear wing of the Clubhouse. 
(3) 
These guidelines are not intended to require that a new house or an expansion of the existing house be an historic restoration of the original Clubhouse. 

(4) 
A proposal for new construction within the footprint of the Clubhouse should include a provision to allow the Town of East Hampton to investigate and record the original Clubhouse foundation at the Town's own expense. This investigation is to be completed within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed nine months, so as not to cause unreasonable delay or to otherwise hinder the development and approval of a proposal for new construction within the footprint of the Clubhouse. 

(5) 
A pool may be sited on the lawn terrace. 


§ D-6. Guidelines for Ditch Plain Coast Guard Station. 
A. These guidelines apply to the c. 1930 Ditch Plain Coast Guard Station which now stands at 136 Benson Drive. The Ditch Plain Station was decommissioned in 1954 and the Colonial Revival style barracks and administration building was moved to this location in 1956. The building has significance for its associations with the Ditch Plain Coast Guard Station while its scale, gable-roofed form, shingled exterior and siting make it compatible with the setting of the Montauk Association Historic District. 
B. The architectural integrity of the Ditch Plain Coast Guard Station should be maintained. Important original features include the gable-roofed form and massing, the dormers on the front roof slope and the front porch which retains the original posts, lintel, cornice and roof. 
§ D-7. Guidelines for nonhistoric houses. 
In the Montauk Association Historic District there are five nonhistoric houses. This classification is made on the individual property sheets in the historic district designation report. These properties are: 109 DeForest Road; 139 DeForest Road; 152 DeForest Road; 156 DeForest Road; and 1692 Montauk Highway. The intent of review of these nonhistoric houses is to see that any changes do not detract from the setting of an historic house and the natural setting of the historic district as a whole. Therefore, any proposed changes to a nonhistoric house should be judged for their compatibility with the historic houses and with their setting. 
A. A proposed change to a nonhistoric house will be judged by the principles of compatibility found in the following "Guidelines for New Construction." 
B. The degree to which a proposed change will be visible from an historic house, the Clubhouse Site, DeForest Road, the bluff at the Atlantic Ocean, Montauk Point State Boulevard, and other roads will be taken into account. 
§ D-8. Guidelines for accessory buildings. 
Most existing garages and outbuildings are located away from the houses and are at a lower elevation where they can be set into the landscape. 
A. Accessory buildings should be located where they will not detract from the historic setting. 
B. Accessory buildings should not be placed within the immediate lawn setting of the historic houses. 
C. Accessory buildings such as garages, sheds and pool houses should be small in scale and compatible with the house, its setting and with the setting of the historic district. 
§ D-9. Guidelines for new construction. 
There are five vacant lots within the Montauk Association Historic District and there is the potential for additional lots with the subdivision of two large parcels. In addition, there is the potential for the five properties with nonhistoric houses to be redeveloped. As these guidelines and the Montauk Association Historic District Designation Report make clear, the relationship of the historic houses to the environment and to each other is the critical value of the district, Even with preservation of the seven Montauk Association houses, the character of the historic district can be lost if new construction intrudes on that setting and breaks up those relationships. 
A. The site for a new house. 
(1) The siting of a proposed new residence is the most important ingredient in achieving a compatible fit into the historic district. 
(a) 
The 1881 Montauk Association site plan drawn by Frederick Law Olmsted specifies the exact location of about two dozen houses. 

(b) 
A group of 10 house sites and the Clubhouse site are arranged along a ridge north of DeForest Road. These are the sites with the highest elevations and were chosen for the seven original houses. Today these houses retain the relationships to one another and to the environment that Olmsted intended. 

(c) 
On the plain south of DeForest Road, within the present historic district, Olmsted drew only two house sites set far apart so as not to interfere with the direct relationship between the houses on Deforest Road and the ocean. On this plain there is one hillock, but instead of placing a house on top of this rise, Olmsted placed it on the forward slope, so that only the roof of the house would be within the vista from the houses on DeForest Road. This is an example of the attention Olmsted gave to the impact of each house on the setting of the others. The second house site is also at a relatively low elevation. Today there are two houses on this plain. In their relationship to the topography and in their alignment these two houses fit into the setting of the historic district in a different way from that envisioned by Olmsted. There remain three vacant lots on this plain and the potential for three new houses to intrude upon the setting of the historic district and to diminish the vivid connection between the historic houses and the Atlantic Ocean. 

(d) 
Another group of 10 house sites is spread out along an arc a considerable distance to the north of the original DeForest Road houses. Olmsted envisioned this as a second informal range of houses similar to those on DeForest Road. Today there are three houses positioned more or less along this arc of Olmsted house sites. Because these houses are set a good distance to the north and the historic houses are oriented toward the west, east and south, they do not interfere 


§ D-9 EAST HAMPTON CODE § D-9 
with any of the primary vistas from the historic houses. 
(2) In evaluating a potential site for a new residence the following guidelines apply: 
(a) 
The potential for siting a new house according to the 1881 Olmsted plan should be evaluated first. 

(b) 
The site of a new house should conform to the rhythm of houses and open space established by the seven original houses. 

(c) 
The site of a new house should not intrude upon the vistas from the historic houses and the Clubhouse site to the Atlantic Ocean or vistas from one historic property to another. 

(d) 
The site of a new house should conform to the character of open space, the relationship to the natural topography and the rhythm evident on the 1881 Olmsted plan for the Montauk Association. 


B. The design of a new house. If a proposed new residence is properly sited, a design that is compatible with the setting of the historic district can be achieved. The seven historic houses are quite consistent in size, massing and materials. These consistent features mean that no one house stands out from the group. A new house should also adhere to these consistent characteristics as detailed in the following guidelines. Some of the nonhistoric houses in the district were designed with these principles in mind and fit well into the setting, such as the 1985 house at 152 DeForest Road. 
(1) 
General. 

(a) 
The Architectural Review Board shall take into account the visibility of the proposed new residence from: the site, porches and interiors of the historic houses; the Clubhouse site; DeForest Road; the bluff at the Atlantic Ocean; Montauk Point State Boulevard; and other roads. Priority will be given to the compatibility of the most visible features of the proposed new house. 

(b) 
In order for the Board to judge the visible features and the impact of a proposed house on the setting of the historic district, a mock-up of the proposed house on the site shall be required. At a minimum, the mock-up shall consist of poles indicating the height at each end of the main roof ridge and poles indicating the height of the walls at the four principal corners. 



(2) 
Restrained design. 

(a) 
All elements of a new house should contribute to an harmonious relationship with the historic houses and their setting. 

(b) 
Creating a new design that embodies the best principles of form, scale, proportions, materials, massing and rhythm of the historic houses is encouraged. 

(c) 
The conservative use of decorative detail would enhance compatibility with the setting of the historic district. 



(3) 
Size and massing. 


(a) A new house that has the size and important dimensions of the seven historic houses would fit best into the setting of the historic district. The dimensions of a new house should be within the range of the following corresponding dimensions of the historic houses and should not exceed these dimensions: 
[1] Range in size (first floor and second floor): 2,000 square feet to 5,000 square feet. 
[2] Range of width of south facade: 32 feet to 54 feet. 
[3] Range of width of south facade including projecting porches: 47 feet to 67 feet. 
(b) The massing of the Agnew House and Hoyt House with a main block and secondary wing to the north provides a model for an appropriate way to break up the mass of a house. 
(4) 
Roof form. 

(a) 
The historic houses have a predominant gable-roof form. Cross gables, dormers, porches and eaves at different levels are used in a restrained manner to give a somewhat complex roofline. 

(b) 
The roof of a new house nay be the most prominent feature within the vistas from the historic houses. A wood-shingled gable roof is a form compatible with the setting of the historic district. First-floor eaves may increase the harmonious fit of a new house into the setting of the district. 

(c) 
Dormer windows, cross gables and other features should be used with great restraint, especially on the roof slope facing the historic houses. 



(5) 
Height. Height is an important element of the design. A lower building will be a less prominent feature of the landscape and will interrupt vistas and relationships to a lesser degree than a taller building. The height of a new house should contribute to a harmonious fit into the setting of the district. 

(6) 
Materials. The materials of a new house should be in harmony with the materials of the historic houses, which have cedar shingle roofs, a combination of shingle and clapboard siding, and painted wood doors, windows and trim. 

(7) 
Proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings. 

(a) 
The windows of a new house should generally be rectangular with a vertical proportion. 

(b) 
The arrangement of windows and doorways should produce a balanced facade. 

(c) 
New houses should have a ratio of door and window area to wall area similar to that of the historic houses. 




§ D-10. Guidelines for demolition. 
In considering a proposal to demolish a building or structure or component of a building or structure the following guidelines apply: 
§ D-10 EAST HAMPTON CODE § E-1 
A. No historic building or structure or significant component thereof should be demolished. 
B. The Architectural Review Board shall consider the historic and architectural significance of the building or component, the contribution the building or component makes to the historic district, and the impact of its removal on the character of the district. 
C. If an application for demolition is based on structural instability or deterioration, a technical report prepared by an architect or engineer is required. The report will detail the problems and provide cost estimates for their correction. 
D. Before approval can be granted to demolish a building, the Architectural Review Board shall determine that all alternatives to demolition have been considered. 
E. The Architectural Review Board may require adequate documentation of a building or component through photographs and measured drawings as a condition of approval when there is no alternative but demolition. 
F. Before approval can be granted to demolish a building, the Architectural Review Board shall require that plans for proposed new construction or other use of the site be submitted and approved. 
§ D-11. Guidelines for relocation. 
The siting of the seven original houses according to the Olmsted plan is a critical component of their historic and architectural significance. The seven historic Montauk Association houses should remain on their original sites. In considering a proposal to relocate a building or structure the following guidelines apply: 
A. The Architectural Review Board shall consider the historic and architectural significance of the building, the contribution the building makes to the historic district on its existing site, and the impact of its relocation on the character of the district. 
B. Before approval can be granted to relocate an historic building, the Architectural Review Board shall determine that all alternatives to relocation have been considered. 
Zoning Appendix E 
SPECIAL HISTORIC LANDMARK GUIDELINES 
[HISTORY: Added by the Town Board of the Town of East Hampton 12-7-2017 by L.L. No. 42-2017] § E-1. Special historic landmarks. 
A. These guidelines apply to the group of properties designated as special historic landmarks which are eligible to have an accessory dwelling unit. This group includes some of our rarest and oldest building types which recall East Hampton's history from the 18th century through the 19th century. Many are small houses on large lots which are well suited to be preserved intact with most expansion occurring as a second residence on the property. 
B. The Architectural Review Board is responsible for reviewing proposed changes that may affect the character and integrity of these historic houses. In doing so, the Board will apply the guidelines in this manual. This guidelines manual identifies work that requires review 
and work that is exempt from review. 
C. If review is required, the owner would submit the Historic Districts and Landmarks Approval Form (available on the East Hampton Town website) to the Secretary of the Architectural Review Board at 300 Pantigo Place, Suite 105. The Architectural Review Board meets on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month at 6:00 p.m. at the Town Hall Meeting Room. 
§ E-2. Guidelines for the historic residence. 
A. Wall materials. All of this group of landmarks retain the historic wall covering of wood shingles. 
(1) 
Landmarks with wood shingle walls should retain this treatment. 

(2) 
Replacing wood shingles with new wood shingles is exempt from review. 

(3) 
Any other proposal to renew the siding on a building requires review. 


B. Roofs. Most of the landmarks retain wood shingle roofs. 
(1) 
Installing a new wood shingle roof is exempt from review. 

(2) 
Installing a new composition shingle roof with shingles of a rectangular design, a small scale, and a uniform dark gray or dark brown tone no lighter than the color of weathered wood shingles is exempt from review. 

(3) 
Installing any other roof material requires review. 

(4) 
Existing and new gutters and leaders are exempt from review. 


C. Doorways. 
(1) 
The intent is to retain front doorways that contribute to the historic character of a building. 

(2) 
Front doors and their enframements are important features of many of these landmarks. The plain doorways of some early buildings are as important as are the more decorative Federal, Greek Revival and Italianate doorways. 

(a) 
Review is required for any proposal to replace a front door or components of a front door enframement. 

(b) 
All significant elements of an historic front doorway, including the door, should be retained, and repaired instead of replaced. 

(c) 
If replacement of any component of an historic front doorway is necessary, the new material should match that being replaced. 

(d) 
Work to a doorway on the side or rear walls and installing a storm/screen door at any doorway is exempt from review. 




D. Windows. 
(1) The intent is to retain windows that contribute to the historic character of a building, 
§ E-2 EAST HAMPTON CODE § E-3 
especially on the front facade. 
(2) Many of the buildings retain significant windows and sashes that contribute to their authentic historic character. 
(a) 
Windows and their trim that contribute to the historic character of a building should be retained. 

(b) 
For any request to replace window components, the Board will consider their condition and the contribution the existing windows make to the historic character of the house. Replacement of deteriorated components for important windows, especially those on the front facade, should match the material, configuration and dimensions of the historic windows. 

(c) 
Work to windows on a rear wall and existing and new storm windows, window screens and window shutters are exempt from review. 


E. Paint and stain. All exterior painting and staining is exempt from review. 
F. Additions and alterations. 
(1) 
Additions and alterations are appropriate when they do not diminish the architectural integrity of a building or diminish its setting. 

(2) 
See § E-3, Guidelines for expansion of the historic house and for a second dwelling, for any plan for a significant addition of gross floor area to the property. 

(a) 
Additions and alterations should not detract from the form and integrity of the historic house or its setting. 

(b) 
Additions and alterations should not alter an important historic feature of a building and should be compatible with the historic building in scale, height, massing, proportion and arrangement of windows and other openings, roof form, texture, materials and architectural details. 

(c) 
Additions should be subordinate in size and scale to the historic building. 

(d) 
The rear wall is the most appropriate location for a modest addition. 

(e) 
The Board realizes greater flexibility is required in reviewing additions or alterations to rear walls of houses where installation of doors, windows, and additions with more glazing than found in the historic house can be expected. 




§ E-3. Guidelines for expansion of the historic house and for a second dwelling. 
A. Special historic landmarks are eligible to have a second residence on the property. In most cases, the intent is to preserve the small historic house intact or with minimal additions while placing the balance of the allowable gross floor area into a new second residence on the property. In most cases the small historic house would become the accessory dwelling to a new larger house. The criteria of § 255-7-60D for approval of a second residence are intended to promote the goal of keeping the historic house intact and, in siting the second residence, to retain the setting of the historic house. 
B. In reviewing an application for expansion of a special historic landmark house or for construction of a second dwelling on a property, the Architectural Review Board shall consider: 
(1) 
The extent to which the proposal achieves the goal of maintaining or enhancing the integrity of the landmark building and its setting, particularly its setting when viewed from the street. 

(2) 
The extent to which the proposal keeps the historic house intact with no additions; or, when this option is not possible, minimizes any additions and keeps any additions subordinate in size and scale to the historic house. Wherever possible, the Board shall encourage applicants to maintain the integrity of the landmark building by avoiding additions, if transferring expansion to a second dwelling is possible. 


§ E-4. Guidelines for the site. 
A. Fences and walls. 
(1) 
The relationship that many of these landmark houses have with the street is an important part of their setting. A moderate regulation of fences placed between the house and the street will preserve the contribution these landmarks make to the historic character of the Town. 

(2) 
The guidelines for a fence also apply to an entry gate at a walk or driveway. 

(a) 
Installing a post-and-rail fence with two rails is exempt from review. 

(b) 
Installing a picket fence less than five feet in height is exempt from review. 

(c) 
Installing a horizontal board fence less than four feet in height and having two or three horizontal boards is exempt from review. 

(d) 
Review is required for any other type of fence, wall or earth berm along the street boundary and in front yards. When a landmark property is bounded by more than one street, only the boundary with the street closest to the landmark building is subject to review. 




B. Driveways and walkways. Driveways and walkways are exempt from review, except that their placement may be part of the review of plans for a proposed second dwelling. 
C. Accessory buildings and structures. Accessory buildings and structures, such as garages, pool houses, swimming pools and tennis courts, are exempt from review, except that their placement may be part of the review of plans for a proposed second dwelling. 
D. Exterior lighting. Exterior lighting is exempt from review. 
E. Landscape plantings. Landscape plantings are exempt from review. 
§ E-5. Guidelines for demolition. 
A. No historic landmark should be demolished. 
B. In considering a proposal to demolish all or part of an historic landmark, the following guidelines apply. 
§ E-5 EAST HAMPTON CODE § E-6 
(1) 
No historic landmark or significant component thereof should be demolished. 

(2) 
If an application for demolition is based on severe structural instability or on extensive damage from fire, flood, hurricane or other casualty, a technical report prepared by an architect or engineer is required. The report will include an assessment of the nature and extent of the structural instability or damage and a determination of the feasibility of the repair of the building and/or reconstruction of damaged or destroyed portions of the building. After reviewing the report, the Board may determine that restoration/reconstruction is impractical or impossible and approve demolition. 

(3) 
The Board may require adequate documentation of an historic building or portion of a building through photographs and measured drawings as a condition of approval when there is no alternative but demolition. 


§ E-6. Guidelines for relocation. 
All but one of this group of historic landmarks are on their original sites. Their exact location and their relationship to the street is an important part of their setting and historic significance. In considering a proposal to relocate a building, the following guidelines apply. 
A. Landmarks should remain on their original sites. 
B. Landmarks which are not now on their original sites, but which have a location or setting that contributes to the character of the Town, should not be relocated unless doing so will enhance the setting of the historic building and allow it to make a greater contribution to the historic character of the Town.
