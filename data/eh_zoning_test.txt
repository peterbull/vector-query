[Amended 11-21-2014 by L.L. No. 21-2014] 
(a) 
No use variance shall be granted by the Board of Appeals without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In order to prove such unnecessary hardship the applicant shall demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that, for each and every permitted use under the zoning regulations for the particular district where the property is located: 

[1] The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent financial evidence. 
[2] The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the district or neighborhood. 
[3] The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood. 
[4] The alleged hardship has not been self-created. 
(b) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proved by the applicant and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community. 

(2) 
Area variances. "Area variances" shall mean the authorization by the Board of Appeals for the use of land which is not allowed by the dimensional or physical requirements of this chapter.

In making such determination the Board of Appeals shall also consider: 

[1] Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the grant of the area variance. 
[2] Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method, feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance. 
[3] Whether the requested area variance is substantial. 
[4] Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood or district. 
[5] Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of an area variance. 

(b) 
The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community. 

(c) 
Additional requirements for variances to § 278-6C and D shall be as follows: 




[1] In addition to the criteria set forth above, the Board of Appeals, before granting a variance from the parking requirements in the business districts, shall also make an affirmative finding that the applicant has demonstrated practical difficulty and that significant economic injury would result from a denial thereof. 
[2] Every decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals which grants a variance from the parking space requirements of § 278-6C and D for off-street parking shall clearly set forth the nature and extent of the reduction by 
§ 278-7 EAST HAMPTON VILLAGE CODE § 278-7 
specifying the number of spaces required to be provided pursuant to said section and the number of spaces required to be provided by the Zoning Board of Appeals, with the difference constituting the number of spaces for which the variance is granted. 
[3] Every determination granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals which varies the requirements of § 278-6C and D for off-street parking, except for variances from § 278-6C and D granted specifically to allow for the construction of new affordable housing or the conversion of an existing building or a portion of an existing building into an affordable housing unit or units, shall be made subject to a condition requiring the payment to the Village of East Hampton of a sum of $10,000, or such other amount as the Board of Trustees may hereafter affix by resolution, for each space or part of a space for which a variance is granted, which sum shall constitute a trust fund to be used by the Board of Trustees exclusively for public off-street parking purposes, including the acquisition and improvement of land for such purposes. "Affordable housing," for purposes of this subsection, shall mean housing for which a maximum monthly rental (excluding utilities) does not exceed 120% of the fair-market rent for existing housing promulgated for the Nassau-Suffolk primary metropolitan statistical area and published annually in the Federal Register by the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Variances granted from § 278-6C and D to allow the establishment of such affordable housing shall be exempt from payment of the fee otherwise required under this provision, but shall be subject to a condition that restrictions are recorded in the County Clerk’s office to ensure the continued use of the premises as affordable housing. [Amended 1-18-2013 by L.L. No. 3-2013] 
[4] There is hereby continued a Village of East Hampton Public Off-Street Parking Trust Fund, to be used by the Board of Trustees exclusively for public off-street parking purposes, including the acquisition and improvement of land for such purposes.

All such applications, except those related to lots used solely for residential purposes, shall not be deemed complete, and therefore ready for a public hearing, until the Design Review Board has concluded its preliminary review pursuant to Chapter 121 of the Code. 
[2] With respect to a lot improved with a single-family residence which is deemed a nonconforming use solely because the lot is also improved with no more than one other building that might otherwise be characterized as an accessory building if it did not contain cooking and/or sleeping facilities, no variance relief shall be required for the proposed extension or alteration of the principal single-family residence, as long as the single-family residence and the proposed expansion conform with all dimensional requirements. This exemption also applies to the construction of new accessory buildings and structures on such a lot, as long as they are permitted in the district and conform to all dimensional requirements. This exemption does not apply to any structures on a lot improved with more than one single-family residence, each of which may be occupied lawfully by separate, independent families, nor does it apply to the extension, expansion or alteration of a building containing sleeping or cooking facilities other than the principal one-family residence on the lot. 
[3] No variance shall be granted to permit the introduction of any outdoor use, including outdoor dining, to a preexisting nonconforming commercial use in a residential district, or to permit the expansion or extension of any such outdoor use, and any variance granted to permit the reconstruction or alteration of any such lawfully existing outdoor use shall not exceed 100% of the lawfully preexisting area of such outdoor use.
